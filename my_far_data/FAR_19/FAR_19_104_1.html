<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> A “set-aside for small business” is the limiting of an acquisition exclusively for participation by small business concerns. For contracts above the micro-purchase threshold, the contracting officer must set the contract aside for small business if there is a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> From two or more responsible small business concerns; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> That are competitive in terms of fair market prices, quality, and delivery.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer makes the determination to do a small business set-aside under paragraph (a). The contracting officer must document the reason when a contract is not set aside for small business as required.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If the contracting officer rejects a recommendation by SBA to do a small business set-aside, see 19.102(f).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold or purchases from required sources under part 8 (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> Committee for Purchase From People Who are Blind or Severely Disabled).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> When using competitive procedures in accordance with 8.304(b)(1), agencies must include Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI), in the solicitation process for a small business set-aside and consider a timely offer from FPI.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> The requirements of paragraph (a) do not preclude the contracting officer from awarding a contract to a small business under the HUBZone Program, SDVOSB Program, WOSB Program, or 8(a) Program. See FAR 19.105 through 19.108.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Any concern, including a supplier, that is awarded a contract or order subject to the nonmanufacturer rule, other than a construction or service acquisition, but proposes to furnish an end item that it did not itself manufacture, process, or produce (<em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, a “nonmanufacturer”), is required to provide an end item that a small business has manufactured, processed, or produced in the United States or its outlying areas.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> When the end item being acquired is a kit of supplies the offeror may not exceed 500 employees, or 150 employees for information technology value-added resellers under NAICS code 541519.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The SBA may grant an individual or a class waiver to the nonmanufacturer rule to allow a nonmanufacturer to provide an end item of an other than small business without regard to the place of manufacture, processing, or production.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> <em class="ph i">Class waiver.</em> An agency may request that SBA waive the requirement at paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section for a specific product or class of products. See 13 CFR 121.1202 for an explanation of when SBA will issue a class waiver.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> <em class="ph i">Individual waiver.</em> The contracting officer may also request a waiver of the requirements at paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section for an individual acquisition once the contracting officer determines through market research that no known small business manufacturers, processors, or producers in the United States or its outlying areas can reasonably be expected to offer an end item meeting the requirements of the solicitation. This type of waiver is known as an individual waiver and would apply only to a specific acquisition.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Requests for waivers must include the content specified at 13 CFR 121.1204 and must be sent via email to <a href="mailto:nmrwaivers@sba.gov">nmrwaivers@sba.gov</a> or by mail to the—Director, Office of Government Contracting, Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street SW, Washington, DC 20416.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> For the most current listing of class waivers, contact the SBA Office of Government Contracting or go to <a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/support-non-manufacturer-rule-class-waiver-list">https://www.sba.gov/document/support-non-manufacturer-rule-class-waiver…</a>.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The contracting officer must provide potential offerors with written notification of any class or individual waiver in the solicitation. If providing the notification after solicitation issuance, the contracting officer must provide potential offerors a reasonable amount of additional time to respond to the solicitation.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> If at least 50 percent of the estimated contract value is composed of items that are manufactured, processed, or produced by small business concerns, then a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule is not required. There is no requirement that each item acquired in a multiple-item acquisition be manufactured, processed, or produced by a small business in the United States or its outlying areas.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If more than 50 percent of the estimated acquisition cost is composed of items manufactured, processed, or produced by other than small business concerns, then a waiver is required. SBA may grant an individual waiver for one or more items in an acquisition in order to ensure that at least 50 percent of the cost of the items to be supplied by the nonmanufacturer comes from small business manufacturers, processors, and producers in the United States or its outlying areas or are subject to a waiver.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> If a small business offeror is both a manufacturer of item(s) and a nonmanufacturer of other item(s) for an acquisition, the contracting officer must apply the manufacturer size standard.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> For evaluation requirements related to set-asides, see FAR 19.205.</p></div>
