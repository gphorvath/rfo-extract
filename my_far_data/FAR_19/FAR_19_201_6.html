<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Definition. Interested party,</em> as used in this section, has the meaning given in 13 CFR 127.102.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> For sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer or SBA may protest the offeror's status as an economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) concern or as a WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program. For all other acquisitions, an interested party (see 13 CFR 127.102) may protest the apparent successful offeror's EDWOSB or WOSB status.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> SBA's protest regulations are found in subpart F “Protests” at 13 CFR 127.600 through 127.605.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Protests relating to small business size status are subject to the procedures of 19.201-2. An interested party seeking to protest both the small business size and WOSB or EDWOSB status of an apparent successful offeror shall file two separate protests.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> All protests shall be in writing and must state all specific grounds for the protest.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> SBA will consider protests challenging the status of a concern if—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The protest presents evidence that the concern is not at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more women who are United States citizens;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The protest presents evidence that the concern is not at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more economically disadvantaged women who are United States citizens, when it is in connection with an EDWOSB contract; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> For WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside or sole-source service contracts or orders, the protest presents evidence that the prime contractor is unduly reliant on a small entity subcontractor that is not a similarly-situated entity as defined in 13 CFR 125.1, or a protest alleging that such subcontractor is performing the primary and vital requirements of a set-aside or sole-source WOSB or EDWOSB contract. For allegations that the prime contractor is unduly reliant on an other-than-small subcontractor, see size protests at 19.201-2, and 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3), which treats the pair as joint venturers for size determination purposes (the “ostensible subcontractor rule”).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Assertions that a protested concern is not an EDWOSB or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, will not be considered by SBA (see 13 CFR 127.603(a)).</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Protest by an interested party.</em></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> An offeror shall submit its protest to the contracting officer—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> To be received by the close of business by the fifth business day after bid opening for sealed bid acquisitions;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> To be received by the close of business by the fifth business day after receipt of the special notification from the contracting officer (see part 15) that identifies the apparently successful offeror for negotiated acquisitions including—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Orders placed under multiple-award contracts where the contracting officer requested rerepresentation for the order (see 13 CFR 127.603(c)(1)); and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Orders set aside for EDWOSB or WOSB concerns under multiple-award contracts that are not partially or totally set aside or reserved for EDWOSB or WOSB concerns (see 13 CFR 127.603(c)(1)), except for orders and blanket purchase agreements placed against a Federal Supply Schedule contract (see part 8); or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> To be received by the close of business on the fifth business day after receipt of notification using other communication means when written notification is not required.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Any protest received after the designated time limit is untimely, unless it is from the contracting officer or SBA.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer must forward all protests to SBA.

This determination must be provided to the SBA Director for Government Contracting and a copy must be included in the contract file.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> <em class="ph i">After SBA decision.</em> SBA will notify the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested concern of its determination.
