If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from SDVOSB concerns eligible under the SDVOSB Program, the SDVOSB set-aside must be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, set aside for small business concerns, as appropriate (see 19.104).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> The procedures at 19.102(f) apply to this section if the contracting officer decides to reject a recommendation of the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, <em class="ph i">see</em> 19.102(b)) to set aside a contract for competition restricted to SDVOSB concerns.</p></div>
