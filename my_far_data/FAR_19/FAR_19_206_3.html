                <h2>19.206-3 Reviewing the subcontracting plan.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">The contracting officer must review the subcontracting plan for adequacy, ensuring that it includes the required information, goals, and assurances (see paragraph (d) of the clause at 52.219-9).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> No detailed standards apply to every subcontracting plan. Instead, the contracting officer must consider each plan in terms of the circumstances of the particular acquisition, including—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Previous involvement of small business concerns as prime contractors or subcontractors in similar acquisitions;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Proven methods of involving small business concerns as subcontractors in similar acquisitions; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The relative success of methods the contractor intends to use to meet the goals and requirements of the plan, as evidenced by records maintained by contractors.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> If, under a sealed bid solicitation, a bidder submits a plan that does not cover each of the required elements (see paragraph (d) of the clause at 52.219-9), the contracting officer must advise the bidder of the deficiency and request submission of a revised plan by a specific date. If the bidder does not submit a plan that includes the required elements by the deadline, the bidder is ineligible for award. If the plan, although responsive, indicates the bidder's intention not to comply with its obligations under the clause at 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, the contracting officer may find the bidder nonresponsible.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> In negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer must determine whether the plan is acceptable based on the negotiation of each of the required elements of the plan (see paragraph (d) of the clause at 52.219-9). Subcontracting goals should be set at a level that the parties reasonably expect can result from the offeror’s good faith efforts to use small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors as much as possible. The contracting officer must take particular care to ensure that the offeror has not submitted unreasonably low goals to minimize exposure to liquidated damages and to avoid the administrative burden of demonstrating good faith efforts. Also, the contracting officer should pay close attention to identifying steps that, if taken, would be considered a good faith effort (see 19.302-2(b) and (c)). Do not negotiate increased goals if a higher goal will significantly increase the Government's cost or make it hard to meet acquisition objectives. An incentive subcontracting clause (see 52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program), may be used when additional and unique contract effort, such as providing technical assistance, could significantly increase subcontract awards to small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned small business concerns.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> To determine whether a proposed subcontracting plan is acceptable, the contracting officer should:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Find information about, and evaluate, the offeror's past performance in awarding subcontracts for the same or similar products or services to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. If information is not available on a specific type of product or service, evaluate the offeror's overall past performance and consider the performance of other contractors on similar efforts.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> According to 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F)(iii), ensure that the goals offered are attainable in relation to—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The subcontracting opportunities available to the contractor, commensurate with the efficient and economical performance of the contract;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The pool of eligible subcontractors available to fulfill the subcontracting opportunities; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The actual performance of such contractor in fulfilling the subcontracting goals specified in prior plans.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Ensure that the subcontracting goals are consistent with the offeror's certified cost or pricing data or data other than certified cost or pricing data.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Evaluate the offeror's make-or-buy policy or program to ensure that it does not conflict with the offeror's proposed subcontracting plan and is in the Government's interest. If the contract involves products or services that are particularly specialized or not generally available in the commercial market, consider the offeror's current capacity to perform the work and the possibility of reduced subcontracting opportunities.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Evaluate subcontracting potential, considering the offeror's make-or-buy policies or programs, the nature of the supplies or services to be subcontracted, the known availability of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in the geographical area where the work will be performed, and the potential contractor's long-standing contractual relationship with its suppliers.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> Advise the offeror of available sources of information on potential small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors, as well as any specific concerns known to be potential subcontractors. If the offerors proposed goals are questionable, the contracting officer must emphasize that the information should be used to develop realistic and acceptable goals.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> Obtain advice and recommendations from the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.102(b)) and the agency small business specialist.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> In making an award that requires a subcontracting plan, the contracting officer must:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Consider the contractor's compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted on previous contracts as a factor to determine contractor responsibility.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Assure that a subcontracting plan was submitted when required.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Notify the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.102(b)) of the opportunity to review the proposed contract (including the plan and supporting documentation). The notice must be issued in sufficient time to provide the representative a reasonable time to review the material and submit advisory recommendations to the contracting officer. Failure of the representative to respond in a reasonable period of time shall not delay contract award.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Determine any fee that may be payable if an incentive is used in conjunction with the subcontracting plan.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Ensure that an acceptable plan is incorporated into and made a material part of the contract.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> Letter contracts and similar undefinitized contracts, which would otherwise meet the requirements of 19.109(a), must contain at least a preliminary basic plan addressing the requirements of paragraph (d) of the clause at 52.219-9 and in such cases require the negotiation of the final plan within 90 days after award or before definitization, whichever occurs first.</p></div>
