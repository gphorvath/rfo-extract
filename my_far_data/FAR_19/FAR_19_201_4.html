                <h2>19.201-4 Protesting a firm's status as a HUBZone small business concern.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Definition.</em> As used in this section—</p><p class="ListL1"><em class="ph i _19.201-4d1e22 Term">Interested party</em> has the meaning given in 13 CFR 126.103.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> For sole-source procurements, SBA or the contracting officer may protest the prospective contractor's certified HUBZone status; for all other procurements, SBA, the contracting officer, or any other interested party may protest the apparent successful offeror's certified HUBZone status (see 13 CFR 126.800).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The Director of SBA's Office of the HUBZone Program will determine whether the concern has certified HUBZone status. If SBA upholds the protest, SBA will remove the concern's HUBZone status in the Small Business Search (SBS). SBA's protest regulations are found in subpart H “Protests” at 13 CFR 126.800 through 126.805.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Protests relating to small business size status are subject to the procedures of 19.201-2. An interested party seeking to protest both the small business size and HUBZone status of an apparent successful offeror shall file two separate protests. Protests relating to small business size status for the acquisition and the HUBZone eligibility requirements will be processed concurrently by SBA.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> All protests must be in writing and must state all specific grounds for the protest (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> why the protested concern did not meet the eligibility requirements at 13 CFR 126.200 at the time of the concern's application to SBA for certification as a HUBZone small business concern or at the time SBA certified or last recertified the concern as a HUBZone small business concern). Assertions that a protested concern is not a HUBZone small business concern, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, will not be considered by SBA (see 13 CFR 126.801(b)).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Protests filed against a HUBZone joint venture must state one or, if applicable, both of the following:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Why the HUBZone small business party to the joint venture did not meet the eligibility requirements at 13 CFR 126.200 at the time of its application to SBA for certification or at the time SBA certified or last recertified the concern as a HUBZone small business concern.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Why the joint venture did not meet the requirements at 13 CFR 126.616 at the time of submission of its offer for a HUBZone contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> SBA will consider protests for HUBZone set-aside or sole-source service contracts or orders, if a HUBZone prime contractor is unduly reliant on a small entity subcontractor that is not a similarly-situated entity as defined in 13 CFR 125.1, or if such subcontractor performs the primary and vital requirements of the contract. For allegations that the prime contractor is unduly reliant on an other-than-small subcontractor, see size protests at 19.201-2 and 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3), which treats the pair as joint venturers for size determination purposes (the “ostensible subcontractor rule”).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Submission of a protest.</em></p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> An interested party shall submit its written protest to the contracting officer—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> For sealed bids—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> By the close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> By the close of business on the fifth business day from the date of identification of the apparent successful offeror, if the price evaluation preference was not applied at the time of bid opening;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> For negotiated acquisitions, by the close of business on the fifth business day after receipt of the special notification from the contracting officer (see part 15) of the apparently successful offeror, including—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Orders placed under multiple-award contracts where the contracting officer requested rerepresentation for the order (see 13 CFR 126.801(d)(1)); and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Orders set aside for HUBZone small businesses under multiple-award contracts that are not partially or totally set-aside or reserved for HUBZone small business concerns (see 13 CFR 126.801(d)(1)), except for orders and blanket purchase agreements placed against a Federal Supply Schedule contract (see part 8); or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> By the close of business on the fifth business day after receipt of notification using other communication means when written notification is not required.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Any protest received after the designated time limits is untimely, unless it is from the contracting officer or SBA.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> The contracting officer must forward all protests with a referral letter to the Director of SBA's Office of the HUBZone Program, by email to <em class="ph i"><a href="mailto:hzprotests@sba.gov">hzprotests@sba.gov</a>.</em> The referral letter must include the following—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The solicitation number;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The contracting officer's name and contact information;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The type of HUBZone contract (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> sole-source, set-aside, full and open competition with a HUBZone price evaluation preference, or reserve for HUBZone small business concerns under a multiple-award contract);</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> For a procurement conducted using full and open competition with a HUBZone price evaluation preference, whether the protester's opportunity for award was affected by the preference;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> For a HUBZone set-aside, whether the protester submitted an offer;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> Whether the protested concern was the apparent successful offeror;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> Whether the procurement was conducted using sealed bid or negotiated procedures;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(8)</span> The bid opening date, if applicable;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(9)</span> The date the protester was notified of the apparent successful offeror;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(10)</span> The date the contracting officer received the protest;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(11)</span> The date the protested concern submitted its initial offer or quote to the contracting officer;

or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Award the contract if—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> SBA does not issue its decision within 15 business days after receipt of the protest; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The contracting officer determines in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting for SBA's determination will be disadvantageous to the Government.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> SBA will determine the merits of the status protest within 15 business days after receipt of a protest, or within any extension of time granted by the contracting officer.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> <em class="ph i">After SBA decision.</em> The SBA will notify the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested concern of the SBA determination. The determination is effective immediately and is final unless overturned on appeal by SBA's Associate Administrator, Office of Government Contracting and Business Development(AA/GC&amp;BD).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> If the contracting officer has withheld contract award and SBA has determined that the protested concern is an eligible HUBZone or dismissed all protests against the protested concern, the contracting officer may award the contract to the protested concern. If the AA/GC&amp;BD subsequently overturns the initial determination or dismissal, the contracting officer may apply the AA/GC&amp;BD decision to the procurement in question.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If the contracting officer has withheld award and the HUBZone Program Director has determined that the protested concern is ineligible, and a timely AA/GC&amp;BD appeal has not been filed, then the contracting officer must not award the contract to the protested concern.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> If the contracting officer has made a written determination in accordance with (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, awarded the contract, and the Director of SBA's Office of the HUBZone Program's ruling sustaining the protest is received after award—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contracting officer must either—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Terminate the contract; or</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Make a written determination that termination is not in the best interests of the Government; and</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Not exercise any options or award further task or delivery orders under the contract.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> SBA will remove the concern's designation as a certified HUBZone small business concern in the Small Business Search (SBS). The concern is not permitted to submit an offer as a HUBZone small business concern until SBA issues a decision that the ineligibility is resolved; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> After SBA updates the concern's designation as a HUBZone small business in SBS, the contracting officer must update the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) to reflect the final decision of the HUBZone Program Director if no appeal is filed.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> If the contracting officer has made a written determination in accordance with (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, awarded the contract, SBA has sustained the protest and determined that the concern is not a HUBZone small business, and a timely (AA/GC&amp;BD) appeal has been filed, then the contracting officer must consider whether performance can be suspended until an (AA/GC&amp;BD) decision is rendered.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> If the AA/GC&amp;BD affirms the decision of the HUBZone Program Director, finding the protested concern is ineligible, and contract award has occurred—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contracting officer must either—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Terminate the contract; or</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Make a written determination that termination is not in the best interests of the Government; and</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Not exercise any options or award further task or delivery orders under the contract;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> SBA will remove the concern's designation as a certified HUBZone small business concern in SBS. The concern is not permitted to submit an offer as a HUBZone small business concern until SBA issues a decision that the ineligibility is resolved or the AA/GC&amp;BD finds the concern is eligible on appeal; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> After SBA updates the concern's designation as a HUBZone small business in SBS, the contracting officer must update FPDS to reflect the AA/GC&amp;BD decision.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> A concern found to be ineligible during a HUBZone status protest is precluded from applying for HUBZone certification for 90 calendar days from the date of the SBA final decision.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(j)</span> <em class="ph i">Appeals of HUBZone status determinations.</em> The protested HUBZone small business concern, the protester, or the contracting officer may file appeals of protest determinations with SBA's AA/GC&amp;BD.

SBA will provide a copy of the decision to the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested HUBZone small business concern. The SBA decision, if received before award, will apply to the pending acquisition. The AA/GC&amp;BD's decision is the final decision.</p></div>
