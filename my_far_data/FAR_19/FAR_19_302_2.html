Protests challenging the socioeconomic status of a HUBZone small business concern must be filed in accordance with 13 CFR 126.801.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> In accordance with 43 U.S.C. 1626, the following procedures apply:</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Subcontracts awarded to an ANC or Indian tribe count toward the subcontracting goals for small business and small disadvantaged business concerns, regardless of the size or SBA certification status of the ANC or Indian tribe.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> If one or more subcontractors are in the subcontract tier between the prime contractor and the ANC or Indian tribe, then the ANC or Indian tribe is required to designate the appropriate contractor(s) to receive credit for the subcontract toward its small business and small disadvantaged business subcontracting goals.</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> In most cases, the appropriate contractor is the contractor that awarded the subcontract to the ANC or Indian tribe.</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If the ANC or Indian tribe designates more than one contractor to count the subcontract toward its goals, the ANC or Indian tribe is required to designate only a portion of the total subcontract award to each contractor. The sum of the amounts designated to various contractors cannot exceed the total value of the subcontract.</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The ANC or Indian tribe is required to give a copy of the written designation to the contracting officer, the prime contractor, and the subcontractors in between the prime contractor and the ANC or Indian tribe within 30 days of the date of the subcontract award.</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> If the contracting officer does not receive a copy of the ANC's or the Indian tribe's written designation within 30 days of the subcontract award, the contracting officer will consider the contractor that awarded the subcontract to the ANC or Indian tribe the designated contractor.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> A contractor acting in good faith may rely on the written representation of an ANC or an Indian tribe as to the status of the ANC or Indian tribe unless an interested party challenges its status or the contracting officer has independent reason to question its status.

However, the mentor-protégé agreement must have been approved by the Director, Small Business Programs of the cognizant DoD military department or defense agency, before developmental assistance costs may be credited against subcontract goals. A list of approved agreements may be obtained at <em class="ph i"><a href="https://business.defense.gov/Programs/Mentor-Protege-Program/">https://business.defense.gov/Programs/Mentor-Protege-Program/</a></em></p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The contracting officer must assess whether the prime contractor made a good faith effort to comply with its small business subcontracting plan.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> If, at completion of the basic contract or any option, a contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of its subcontracting plan, which includes meeting its subcontracting goals, the contracting officer must review all available information for an indication that the contractor has not made a good faith effort to comply with the plan. If no such indication is found, the contracting officer must document the file accordingly.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If the contracting officer decides, according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(9) states that the contractor is in material breach of its contract. Further, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F) directs that the contractor must pay liquidated damages. Accordingly, the contracting officer must initiate action to assess liquidated damages.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contracting officer must give the contractor written notice under the clause at 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages—Subcontracting Plan. The notice must—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Specify the material breach and indicate that it may be included in the contractor's past performance rating;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Advise the contractor of the possibility that it may have to pay liquidated damages to the Government;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> Give the contractor an opportunity to respond to the notice (within 15 working days or longer, as necessary) to show the good faith efforts it made before the contracting officer issues the final decision; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(D)</span> Specify that the contractor’s failure to respond may be taken as an admission that no valid explanation exists.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If, after consideration of all the pertinent data and the contractor’s response to the notice in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the contracting officer finds that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, the contracting officer must issue a final decision to the contractor to that effect, require the contractor to pay liquidated damages, and state the amount to pay. The contracting officer's final decision must state that the contractor has the right to appeal under the clause in the contract entitled Disputes. The contracting officer must follow procedures in the clause at 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages—Subcontracting Plan.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The amount of damages attributable to the contractor's failure to comply must be equal to the actual dollar amount by which the contractor failed to achieve each subcontracting goal.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Liquidated damages must be in addition to any other remedies that the Government may have.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> In determining whether a contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, a contracting officer must look to the totality of the contractor's actions, consistent with the information and assurances provided in its plan. The fact that the contractor failed to meet its subcontracting goals does not, in and of itself, constitute a failure to make a good faith effort. The contracting officer may consider any of the following, though not all inclusive, to be indicators of a good faith effort:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Breaking out work to be subcontracted into economically feasible units, as appropriate, to facilitate small business participation.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Conducting market research to identify potential small business subcontractors through all reasonable means, such as searching SAM, posting notices or solicitations on SBA's SUBNet, participating in business matchmaking events, and attending preproposal conferences.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Soliciting small business concerns as early in the acquisition process as practicable to allow them sufficient time to submit a timely offer for the subcontract.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Providing interested small businesses with adequate and timely information about plans, specifications, and requirements for performance of the prime contract to assist them in submitting a timely offer for the subcontract.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Negotiating in good faith with interested small businesses.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vi)</span> Directing small businesses that need additional assistance to SBA.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vii)</span> Assisting interested small businesses in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, required insurance, necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or services.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(viii)</span> Utilizing the available services of small business associations;

A copy of the contracting officer's final decision assessing liquidated damages must be provided to other contracting officers with contracts subject to the commercial plan.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Every contracting officer with a contract that is subject to a commercial plan shall include in the contract file a copy of the approved plan and a copy of the final decision assessing liquidating damages, if applicable.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> The contracting officer must assess the prime contractor's written explanation concerning its failure to use a small business concern in the performance of the contract in the same scope, amount, and quality used in preparing and submitting the bid or proposal, if applicable.</p></div>
