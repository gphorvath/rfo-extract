However, a contracting officer may establish separate subcontracting goals for each order under an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract. When a contract modification exceeds the subcontracting plan threshold (see 19.109(a)) or an option is exercised, the goals of an existing subcontracting plan shall be amended to reflect any new subcontracting opportunities not envisioned at the time of contract award. These goal changes do not apply retroactively.</p></div>
