                <h2>19.101 Small business goals.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> It is the Government’s policy to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business and other small business socioeconomic categories (i.e. veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns). Heads of contracting activities are responsible for achieving goals for small business and those other socioeconomic categories (15 U.S.C. 644(g)).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Agencies must measure the extent of participation by small business and other small business socioeconomic categories in Government acquisitions in terms of the total value of contracts placed during each fiscal year. Agencies must report this data to the Small Business Administration (SBA) at the end of each fiscal year (see 4.301).</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> SBA certifies offerors as veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, and women-owned small business concerns under the WOSB Program. SBA certifications can be found in the Small Business Search (SBS) website. To be eligible as a small business concern or small disadvantaged business concern, an offeror is required to represent in good faith that it meets the definition of those respective terms.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Insert the provision at 52.219-1, Small Business Program Representations, in solicitations exceeding the micro-purchase threshold when the contract is for supplies to be delivered or services to be performed in the United States or its outlying areas, or when the contracting officer has applied this part in accordance with 19.000(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Use the provision with its Alternate II in solicitations that will result in a multiple-award contract with more than one NAICS code assigned. This is authorized for solicitations issued after October 1, 2028 (see 19.103(b)(2)).</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Insert the clause at 52.219-28, Postaward Small Business Program Rerepresentation, in solicitations and contracts exceeding the micro-purchase threshold when the contract is for supplies to be delivered or services to be performed in the United States or its outlying areas, or when the contracting officer has applied this part in accordance with 19.000(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Use the clause with its Alternate I in solicitations and the resulting multiple-award contracts with more than one NAICS code. This is authorized for solicitations issued after October 1, 2028 (see 19.103(b)(2)).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Contracting officers can use various acquisition strategies to further the policy and achieve the goals referenced in paragraph (a). As summarized below, some are discretionary, but others are mandatory for certain acquisitions.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Contracting officers must plan acquisitions (i.e. contracts) so that, if practicable, more than one small business concern may perform the work, if the work exceeds the amount for which a surety may be guaranteed by SBA against loss under 15 U.S.C. 694b (see definition of “applicable statutory limit” at 13 CFR 115.10).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Contracting officers must, to the extent practicable, encourage maximum participation by small business concerns in acquisitions. They can do this by publicizing solicitations and contract awards through the Governmentwide point of entry (see subparts 5.2 and 5.3).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Contracting officers must set aside contracts valued at more than the micro-purchase threshold for small businesses in certain circumstances. See 19.104.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Contracting officers may set aside or sole source contracts under the HUBZone Program. See 19.105.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Contracting officers may set aside or sole source contracts under the SDVOSB Program. See 19.106.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> Contracting officers may set aside or sole source contracts under the WOSB Program. See 19.107.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> Contracting officers may set aside or sole source contracts under the 8(a) Program. See 19.108.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(8)</span> Contracting officers may set aside task orders or delivery orders. See 19.111-2.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(9)</span> Contracting officers must require a small business subcontracting plan in certain acquisitions. See 19.109 and 19.302-1.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(10)</span> Contracting officers must use a HUBZone price evaluation preference in full and open competitions. See 19.110.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(11)</span> Contracting officers may use reserves on multiple-award contracts for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3). See 19.112.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> In certain instances, contracting officers must award to the small business when there are equal low bids from a small and other than small business. See 19.203.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> When an apparent successful small business offeror has been determined to be nonresponsible, contracting officers must refer the business to SBA for a certificate of competency. A certificate of competency would allow award to be made to that small business offeror. See 19.204.</p></div>
