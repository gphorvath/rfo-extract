<div class="body conbody"><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Locating size standards and North American Industry Classification System codes.</em></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> SBA establishes small business size standards on an industry-by-industry basis. Small business size standards and corresponding North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are provided at 13 CFR 121.201. They are also available at <em class="ph i"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/support--table-size-standards">https://www.sba.gov/document/support--table-size-standards</a></em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> NAICS codes are updated by the Office of Management and Budget through its Economic Classification Policy Committee every five years. New NAICS codes are not available for use in Federal contracting until SBA publishes corresponding size standards. NAICS codes are available from the U.S. Census Bureau at <em class="ph i"><a href="https://www.census.gov/naics/">https://www.census.gov/naics/</a></em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> SBA determines the size status of a concern, including its affiliates, as of the date the concern represents that it is small to the contracting officer as part of its initial offer, which includes price.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> When an agency uses a solicitation for a multiple-award contract that does not require offers for the contract to include price, SBA determines size as of the date of initial offer for the multiple-award contract, whether or not the offer includes price or the price is evaluated. (See 13 CFR 121.404(a)(1)(iv)).</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Determining the appropriate NAICS codes for the solicitation.</em></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Unless required to do otherwise by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, contracting officers must assign one NAICS code and corresponding size standard to all solicitations, contracts, and task or delivery orders. The contracting officer must determine the appropriate NAICS code by classifying the product or service being acquired in the one industry that best describes the principal purpose of the supply or service being acquired.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> For solicitations issued on or before October 1, 2028, that will result in multiple-award contracts, the contracting officer must assign a NAICS code in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> For solicitations issued after October 1, 2028, that will result in multiple-award contracts, the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Assign a single NAICS code (and corresponding size standard) that best describes the principal purpose of both the acquisition and each subsequent order; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Divide the acquisition into distinct portions or categories (e.g., line item numbers, Special Item Numbers, sectors, functional areas, or equivalent) and assign each portion or category a single NAICS code and size standard that best describes the principal purpose of the supplies or services to be acquired under that distinct portion or category.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The contracting officer's designation is final unless appealed in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Application of small business size standards to solicitations.</em></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer must apply the size standard in effect on the date the solicitation is issued.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The contracting officer may amend the solicitation and use the new size standard if SBA amends the size standard and it becomes effective before the due date for receipt of initial offers.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Appealing the contracting officer's North American Industry Classification System code and size standard determination</em>. The contracting officer's determination is final unless appealed as follows:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> An appeal of a contracting officer's NAICS code designation and the applicable size standard must be served and filed within 10 calendar days after the issuance of the initial solicitation or any amendment affecting the NAICS code or size standard. However, SBA may file a NAICS code appeal at any time before offers are due.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Appeals of a contracting officer's NAICS code designation or applicable size standard may be filed with SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) by—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Any person adversely affected by a NAICS code designation or applicable size standard. However, with respect to a particular sole source 8(a) contract, only the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development may appeal a NAICS code designation; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The Associate or Assistant Director for the SBA program involved, through SBA's Office of General Counsel.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Contracting officers must advise the public, by amendment to the solicitation, of the existence of a NAICS code appeal (see part 5). Such notices must include the procedures and the deadline for interested parties to file and serve arguments concerning the appeal.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> SBA's OHA will dismiss summarily an untimely NAICS code appeal.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> NAICS code appeals are filed in accordance with 13 CFR 121.1103.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> Upon receipt of a NAICS code appeal, OHA will notify the contracting officer by a notice and order of the date OHA received the appeal, the docket number, and the Administrative Judge assigned to the case. The contracting officer's response to the appeal, if any, must include argument and evidence (see 13 CFR part 134), and must be received by OHA within 15 calendar days from the date of the docketing notice and order, unless otherwise specified by the Administrative Judge. Upon receipt of OHA's docketing notice and order, the contracting officer must withhold award, unless withholding award is not in the best interests of the Government, and immediately send to OHA an electronic link to or a paper copy of both the original solicitation and all amendments relating to the NAICS code appeal. The contracting officer must inform OHA of any amendments, actions, or developments concerning the procurement in question.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> After close of record, OHA will issue a decision and inform the contracting officer. If OHA's decision is received by the contracting officer before the date the offers are due, the decision shall be final and the solicitation must be amended to reflect the decision, if appropriate. OHA's decision received after the due date of the initial offers shall not apply to the pending solicitation but shall apply to future solicitations of the same products or services.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> For procedures related to determining size prior to award, see FAR 19.201.</p></div>
