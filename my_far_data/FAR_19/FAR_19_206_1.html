<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Contractors may establish, on a plant or division-wide basis, a master subcontracting plan (see 19.001) that contains all the elements required by the clause at 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, except goals. Master subcontracting plans shall be effective for a 3-year period after approval by the contracting officer; however, it is incumbent upon contractors to maintain and update master subcontracting plans. Changes required to update master subcontracting plans are not effective until approved by the contracting officer. A master subcontracting plan, when incorporated in an individual plan, shall apply to that contract throughout the life of the contract.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> An individual subcontracting plan contains all the elements required by the clause at 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, and separate statements and goals based on total subcontract dollars for the basic contract and for each option.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> A commercial subcontracting plan is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial products and commercial services.
