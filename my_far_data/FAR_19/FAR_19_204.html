                <h2>19.204Certificate of Competency.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">A Certificate of Competency (COC) is the certificate SBA issues stating that, for the purpose of receiving and performing a specific Government contract, the holder is responsible with respect to all elements of responsibility, including, but not limited to, capability, competency, capacity, credit, integrity, perseverance, tenacity, and limitations on subcontracting.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The COC program empowers SBA to certify to Government contracting officers regarding all elements of responsibility of any small business concern to receive and perform a specific Government contract. The COC program does not extend to questions concerning regulatory requirements that other Federal agencies impose and enforce.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The COC program applies to all Government acquisitions except for 8(a) sole-source awards. If a contracting officer determines an apparent successful small business offeror to be nonresponsible, the contracting officer must refer that small business to SBA for a possible COC, even if the next acceptable offer is from a small business. Contracting officers, including those located overseas, must comply with this section for U.S. small business concerns.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> When a solicitation requires a small business to comply with the limitations on subcontracting, a contracting officer's finding that a small business cannot comply with the limitation must be treated as an element of responsibility and must be subject to the COC process.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> When a contracting officer determines and documents that an apparent successful small business offeror lacks one or more elements of responsibility listed in the introductory text of this section (for sureties see 28.101-3(f) and 28.203-1(e)), the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Withhold contract award; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Refer the matter to the appropriate SBA Government Contracting Area Office (Area Office) serving the area where the offeror’s headquarters is located, in accordance with agency procedures.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> The referral must include—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A notice that a small business concern has been determined to be nonresponsible, specifying the element(s) of responsibility the contracting officer found lacking; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If applicable, a copy of the following:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Solicitation.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Final offer submitted by the apparent successful offeror whose responsibility is at issue.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> The contracting officer must withhold award for a period of 15 business days following receipt by the appropriate SBA Area Office of a referral that includes all required documentation.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> In order to determine whether to issue or deny a COC, SBA conducts a review in accordance with 13 CFR 125.5. At the completion of the COC review process, SBA will notify the concern and the contracting officer that the COC is denied or is being issued.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(h)</span> If new information causes the contracting officer to determine that the concern referred to the SBA is actually responsible to perform the contract, and award has not already been made under paragraph (j) of this section, the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Reverse the determination of nonresponsibility;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Notify the SBA of this action;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Withdraw the referral; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Proceed to award the contract.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> SBA COCs are final with respect to all elements of responsibility of prospective small business contractors. An SBA-certified concern must not be required to meet any other requirements of responsibility. Where SBA issues a COC, the contracting officer may decide not to award to that offeror for reasons unrelated to responsibility.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(j)</span> The contracting officer must award the contract to another appropriately selected and responsible offeror if SBA has not issued a COC within 15 business days after receiving the referral.</p></div>
