<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Definition. Interested party,</em> as used in this section, has the meaning given in 13 CFR 134.1002(b).</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">General.</em></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> For sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), or SBA may protest the apparently successful offeror's service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) status. For all other acquisitions, any interested party may protest the apparently successful offeror's SDVOSB status.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> SBA's protest regulations are found in 13 CFR 128.500 and 13 CFR part 134.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Protests relating to small business size status are subject to the procedures of 19.201-2. An interested party seeking to protest both the small business size and SDVOSB status of an apparent successful offeror shall file two separate protests.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> All protests must be in writing and must state all specific grounds for the protest.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> OHA will consider protests challenging the SDVOSB status or the ownership and control of a concern if—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> For status protests, the protester presents evidence supporting the contention that the owner(s) cannot provide documentation from the VA to show that they meet the definition of “service-disabled veteran” or “service-disabled veteran with a permanent and severe disability” as set forth in 13 CFR 128.102; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> For ownership and control protests, the protester presents evidence that the concern is not 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans. In the case of a veteran with a permanent and severe disability, the protester presents evidence that the concern is not controlled by the veteran, spouse, or permanent caregiver of such veteran; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> For set-aside or sole-source service contract or order ostensible subcontractor protests, the protester presents credible evidence of the alleged undue reliance on a small entity subcontractor that is not a similarly-situated entity as defined in 13 CFR 125.1, or credible evidence that the small non-similarly situated entity is performing the primary and vital requirements of the contract. For allegations that the prime contractor is unduly reliant on an other-than-small subcontractor, see size protests at 19.201-2, and 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3), which treats the pair as joint venturers for size determination purposes (the “ostensible subcontractor rule”); or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> For joint venture protests, the protester presents evidence that the managing SDVOSB joint venture partner does not meet the requirements at 13 CFR 128.402.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Assertions that a protested concern is not a SDVOSB concern, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, will not be considered by OHA (see 13 CFR 134.1005)</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Protest by an interested party.</em></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> An interested party (except contracting officers should see paragraph (f)(1) of this section) shall submit its protest to the contracting officer—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> To be received by close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening for sealed bid acquisitions;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> To be received by close of business on the fifth business day after receipt of the special notification from the contracting officer (see part 15) that identifies the apparently successful offeror for negotiated acquisitions, including—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Orders placed under multiple-award contracts where the contracting officer requested rerepresentation for the order (see 13 CFR 134.1004(a)(3)(ii)); and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Orders set aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses under multiple-award contracts that are not partially or totally set aside or reserved for SDVOSB concerns (see 13 CFR 134.1004(a)(3)(i)), except for orders and blanket purchase agreements placed against a Federal Supply Schedule contract (see part 8);</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> To be received by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the intended awardee for an order that is set aside for SDVOSBs under a multiple-award contract that was not totally or partially set aside or reserved for SDVOSB concerns.
