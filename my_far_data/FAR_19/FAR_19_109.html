<div class="body conbody"><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this section, 15 U.S.C. 637(d) imposes the following requirements regarding subcontracting with small businesses and small business subcontracting plans:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> In negotiated acquisitions, each solicitation of offers to perform a contract that is expected to exceed $900,000 ($2 million for construction of any public facility) and that has subcontracting possibilities, must require the apparently successful offeror to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan. If the apparently successful offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the contracting officer within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the offeror will be ineligible for award. For a multiple-award contract with more than one North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, see paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> In sealed bidding acquisitions, each invitation for bids to perform a contract that is expected to exceed $900,000 ($2 million for construction of any public facility) and that has subcontracting possibilities, must require the bidder selected for award to submit a subcontracting plan. If the selected bidder fails to submit a plan within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the bidder will be ineligible for award. For a multiple-award contract with more than one NAICS code, see paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For a multiple-award contract with more than one NAICS code, the solicitation referenced in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section shall require the apparently successful offeror to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan for either the distinct portion(s) or category(ies) of their proposal for which the offeror is other than small or for the entirety of their proposal, at the offeror's discretion. When determining the need for a subcontracting plan, the contracting officer must consider the cumulative dollar value of the portion(s) or category(ies) of the offeror's proposal for which the offeror is other than small.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Subcontracting plans (see paragraph (a) of this section) are not required—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> From small business concerns;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For personal services contracts; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> For contracts or contract modifications that will be performed entirely outside of the United States and its outlying areas.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer must determine whether subcontracting possibilities exist by considering relevant factors such as—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Whether firms engaged in the business of furnishing the types of items to be acquired usually contract for performance of part of the work or maintain sufficient in-house capability to perform the work;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Whether there are likely to be product prequalification requirements; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Whether the firm can acquire any portion of the work with minimal or no disruption to performance (with consideration given to the time remaining until contract completion), and at fair market value, when a plan is required under 19.302-1.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If it is determined that there are no subcontracting possibilities, the determination must include a detailed rationale, be approved at a level above the contracting officer, and placed in the contract file.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> In solicitations for negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer may require the submission of subcontracting plans with initial offers or at any other time prior to award. In determining when subcontracting plans should be required, as well as when and with whom plans should be negotiated, the contracting officer must consider the integrity of the competitive process, the goal of affording maximum practicable opportunity for small business and the socioeconomic categories to participate, and the burden placed on offerors.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Insert the clause at 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, in solicitations and contracts when the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold unless—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> A personal services contract is considered (see 37.104); or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The contract, together with all of its subcontracts, will be performed entirely outside of the United States and its outlying areas.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Insert the clause at 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, in solicitations and contracts that offer subcontracting possibilities, are expected to exceed $900,000 ($2 million for construction of any public facility), and are required to include the clause at 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, unless the acquisition is set aside or is to be accomplished under the 8(a) program. When—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Contracting by sealed bidding rather than by negotiation, use the clause with its Alternate I;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Contracting by negotiation, and subcontracting plans are required with initial proposals as provided for in 19.109(d), use the clause with its Alternate II; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> The contract action will not be reported in the Federal Procurement Data System pursuant to part 4, use the clause with its Alternate III.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Insert the clause at 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages—Subcontracting Plan, in all solicitations and contracts containing the clause at 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, or the clause with its Alternate I or II<em class="ph i">.</em></p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer may, when contracting by negotiation, insert in solicitations and contracts a clause substantially the same as the clause at 52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program, when a subcontracting plan is required, and inclusion of a monetary incentive is, in the judgment of the contracting officer, necessary to increase subcontracting opportunities for small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns, and is commensurate with the efficient and economical performance of the contract; unless the conditions in paragraph (f)(3) of this section are applicable. The contracting officer may vary the terms of the clause as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Various approaches may be used in the development of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns' subcontracting incentives. They can take many forms, from a fully quantified schedule of payments based on actual subcontract achievement to an award-fee approach employing subjective evaluation criteria (see paragraph (f)(3) of this section). The incentive should not reward the contractor for results other than those that are attributable to the contractor's efforts under the incentive subcontracting program.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> As specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the contracting officer may include small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontracting as one of the factors to be considered in determining the award fee in a cost-plus-award-fee contract; in such cases, however, the contracting officer must not use the clause at 52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> The contracting officer must provide the SBA's procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.102(b)) a reasonable period of time to review any solicitation requiring submission of a subcontracting plan and to submit advisory findings before the solicitation is issued.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(h)</span> For evaluation requirements related to subcontracting plans, see FAR 19.206.</p></div>
