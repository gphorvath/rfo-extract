<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Competitive 8(a) policy.</em> An acquisition offered to the SBA under the 8(a) program must be awarded on the basis of competition limited to eligible 8(a) participants whenâ€”</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> There is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible and responsible 8(a) participants will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair market price; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The anticipated total value of the contract, including options, will exceed $7 million for acquisitions assigned manufacturing North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and $4.5 million for all other acquisitions.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Above competitive thresholds</em>. Where an acquisition exceeds the competitive threshold (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section), the SBA may accept the requirement for a sole source 8(a) award only after the contracting officer has complied with the requirements for other than full and open competition in accordance with 6.103.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Prohibition on splitting requirements</em>. A proposed 8(a) requirement with an estimated value exceeding the applicable competitive threshold amount shall not be divided into several requirements for lesser amounts in order to use 8(a) sole source procedures for award to a single firm.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Below competitive thresholds</em>.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> To ensure fair market pricing and to prepare 8(a) participants for competition, SBA has approved certain government-wide contracts for competition amongst the 8(a) contract-holders (see 19.111-2) at any dollar value, including below the competitive thresholds. Where an acquisition is below the competitive threshold (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section), contracting officers must first try conducting the acquisition as a competitive 8(a) order using these government-wide contracts before proceeding with a sole source 8(a) award. To determine whether SBA has provided approval for a particular government-wide contract, refer to the ordering procedures for that contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development may approve a contracting office's request for a competitive 8(a) award below the competitive thresholds when not using the contracts referenced in paragraph (d)(1). Such requests will be approved only on a limited basis and will be primarily granted where technical competitions are appropriate or where a large number of responsible 8(a) participants are available for competition. In determining whether a request to compete below the threshold will be approved, the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development will, in part, consider the extent to which the contracting activity is supporting the 8(a) program on a noncompetitive basis. The agency may include recommendations for competition below the threshold in the offering letter or by separate correspondence to the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development.</p></div>
