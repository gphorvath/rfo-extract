                <h2>19.102 Coordination.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> SBA helps contracting personnel ensure their agency meets their small business goals. The Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), or for the Department of Defense, the Director of the Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) serves as the agency focal point for interfacing with SBA. In certain instances, coordinating with SBA, the Director of the OSDBU, or the Director of OSBP is required.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The SBA may assign one or more procurement center representatives (PCRs) to any contracting activity or contract administration office to carry out SBA policies and programs. Assigned SBA PCRs are required to comply with the contracting agency's directives governing the conduct of contracting personnel and the release of contract information. The SBA must obtain for its PCRs security clearances required by the contracting agency.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If an SBA PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity or contract administration office, contact the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the procuring activity is located for assistance in carrying out SBA policies and programs. See <em class="ph i"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/counseling-help/procurement-center-representative-directory">https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/counseling-help/procurement-cen…</a></em> for the location of the SBA office servicing the activity.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Upon their request and subject to applicable acquisition and security regulations, contracting officers must give SBA PCRs (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see paragraph (b) of this section) access to all reasonably obtainable contract information that is directly pertinent to their official duties.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> The duties assigned by SBA to its PCR are set forth at 13 CFR 125.2(b) and include but are not limited to reviewing proposed acquisitions to recommend the set-aside or sole-source award to a small business of selected acquisitions.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Contracting officers must provide a copy of the proposed acquisition package and other reasonably obtainable information related to the acquisition to the SBA procurement center representative at least 30 days before the solicitation is issued if—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The proposed acquisition is for supplies or services that a small business currently provides, and the proposed acquisition is of a quantity or estimated dollar value that makes it unlikely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The proposed acquisition is for construction and seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects, and the magnitude of this packaging or consolidation makes it unlikely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The proposed acquisition is for a consolidated or bundled requirement. The contracting officer must provide all information to justify the consolidation or bundling. The contracting officer must also provide the same information to the agency OSDBU or for the Department of Defense, the OSBP.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For acquisitions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, provide a statement explaining why the—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Proposed acquisition cannot be structured to make it likely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Consolidated construction project cannot be acquired as separate discrete projects; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Bundling is necessary and justified.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Process the 30-day notification at the same time as other processing steps required before issuing the solicitation.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> If the SBA PCR believes that the acquisition as proposed makes it unlikely that small businesses can compete for the prime contract, the representative will recommend any alternate contracting method that the representative reasonably believes will increase small business prime contracting opportunities. The representative has 15 days after receiving the package to make the recommendation to the contracting officer.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> If the contracting officer rejects a recommendation of the SBA PCR (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see paragraph (b) of this section), written notice must be furnished to the appropriate SBA representative within 5 working days of the contracting officer's receipt of the recommendation.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see paragraph (b) of this section) may appeal the contracting officer's rejection to the head of the contracting activity within 2 working days after receiving the notice. The head of the contracting activity shall render a decision in writing, and provide it to the SBA representative within 7 working days. Pending issuance of a decision to the SBA representative, the contracting officer must suspend action on the acquisition.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If the head of the contracting activity agrees that the contracting officer's rejection was appropriate—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Within 2 working days, the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see paragraph (b) of this section) may request the contracting officer to suspend action on the acquisition until the SBA Administrator appeals to the agency head (see paragraph (f)(5) of this section); and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The SBA must be allowed 15 working days after making such a written request, within which the Administrator of SBA—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> May appeal to the Secretary of the Department concerned; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Must notify the contracting officer whether the further appeal has, in fact, been taken. If notification is not received by the contracting officer within the 15-day period, it is deemed that the SBA request to suspend the contract action has been withdrawn and that an appeal to the Secretary was not taken.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> When the contracting officer has been notified within the 15-day period that the SBA has appealed to the agency head, the head of the contracting activity (or designee) must forward justification for its decision to the agency head. The contracting officer must suspend contract action until notification is received that the SBA appeal has been settled.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The agency head must reply to the SBA within 30 working days after receiving the appeal. The decision of the agency head shall be final.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> A request to suspend action on an acquisition need not be honored if the contracting officer determines that proceeding to contract award and performance is in the public interest. The contracting officer must include in the contract file a statement of the facts justifying the determination, and must promptly notify the SBA representative of the determination and provide a copy of the justification.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> Contracting officers must consider the recommendations of the agency Director of the OSDBU or for the Department of Defense, the Director of the OSBP as to whether a particular contract should be set aside (see 19.104). Agencies must establish procedures including dollar thresholds for the Director to review acquisitions to make these recommendations. The contracting officer must document in the contract file whenever the Director's recommendations are not accepted.</p></div>
