<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> This subpart prescribes policies and procedures to implement E.O. 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal Contractors, dated September 7, 2015, and Department of Labor implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 13.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> This subpart applies to—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Contracts that—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Are covered by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute (41 U.S.C. chapter 67, formerly known as the Service Contract Act, subpart 22.10), or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute (40 U.S.C. chapter 31, Subchapter IV, formerly known as the Davis-Bacon Act, 22.402-3); and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Require performance in whole or in part within the United States. When performance is in part within and in part outside the United States, this subpart applies to the part of the contract that is performed within the United States; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Employees performing on or in connection with such contracts whose wages are governed by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, or the Fair Labor Standards Act, including employees who qualify for an exemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage and overtime provisions.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The following are excluded from coverage under this subpart:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Employees performing in connection with contracts covered by the E.O. for less than 20 percent of their work hours in a given workweek. This exclusion is inapplicable to employees performing on contracts covered by the E.O., <em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> those employees directly engaged in performing the specific work called for by the contract, at any point during the workweek (see 29 CFR 13.4(e)).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Until the earlier of the date the agreement terminates or January 1, 2020, employees whose covered work is governed by a collective bargaining agreement ratified before September 30, 2016, that—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Already provides 56 hours (or 7 days, if the agreement refers to days rather than hours) of paid sick time (or paid time off that may be used for reasons related to sickness or health care) each year; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Provides less than 56 hours (or 7 days, if the agreement refers to days rather than hours) of paid sick time (or paid time off that may be used for reasons related to sickness or health care) each year, provided that each year the contractor provides covered employees with the difference between 56 hours (or 7 days) and the amount provided under the existing agreement in accordance with 29 CFR 13.4(f).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The Government's unilateral exercise of a pre-negotiated option to renew an existing contract that does not contain the clause at 52.222-62 will not automatically trigger the application of that clause. (See definition of “new contract” at 29 CFR 13.2).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Nothing in E.O. 13706 or 29 CFR part 13 shall excuse noncompliance with or supersede any applicable Federal or State law, any applicable law or municipal ordinance, or a collective bargaining agreement requiring greater paid sick leave or leave rights than those established under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR part 13. For additional details regarding interaction with the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and State and local paid sick time laws, see 29 CFR 13.5(f)(2) through (4).</p></div>
