                <h2>22.1004-1 Revisions to wage determinations.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The Wage and Hour Administrator may issue revisions to prevailing wage determinations periodically. The need for inclusion of a revised prevailing wage determination in a contract is determined by the date of receipt of the revised prevailing wage determination by the contracting agency.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> If a wage determination was obtained through the e98 process, and commencement of work under a negotiated contract has been delayed, for whatever reason, more than 60 days from the date indicated on the previously submitted e98, the contracting officer must submit a new e98. Any revision of a wage determination received by the contracting agency as a result of that communication must supersede the earlier response as the wage determination applicable to the particular acquisition subject to the time frames in 22.1003(a)(3) and (4).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The contracting officer must obtain wage determinations for each contract modification which brings the contract above $2,500 and—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Extends the existing contract pursuant to an option clause or otherwise; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Changes the scope of the contract whereby labor requirements are affected significantly.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> The contracting officer must obtain wage determinations for each multiple year contract in excess of $2,500 upon the—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Annual anniversary date if the contract is subject to annual appropriations; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Biennial anniversary date if the contract is not subject to annual appropriations and its proposed term exceeds 2 years—unless otherwise advised by the Wage and Hour Division.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> If the contracting officer has submitted an e98 to Department of Labor requesting a wage determination based on a collective bargaining agreement and the Department of Labor is unable to provide the wage determination by the latest date needed to maintain the acquisition schedule, the contracting officer must incorporate the collective bargaining agreement itself in a contract action (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, exercise of option) and include a wage determination referencing that collective bargaining agreement created by use of the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> website.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> If the Department of Labor discovers and determines, whether before or after a contract award, that a contracting officer made an erroneous determination that the Service Contract Labor Standards statute did not apply to a particular acquisition or failed to include an appropriate wage determination in a covered contract, the contracting officer, within 30 days of notification by the Department of Labor, must include in the contract the clause at 52.222-41 and any applicable wage determination issued by the Administrator. If the contract is subject to 41 U.S.C. 6707(f), the Administrator may require retroactive application of that wage determination. The contracting officer must equitably adjust the contract price to reflect any changed cost of performance resulting from incorporating a wage determination or revision.</p></div>
