<div class="body conbody"><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The Department of Labor may modify a wage determination to make it current by specifying only the items being changed or by reissuing the entire determination with changes incorporated.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> All project wage determination modifications expire on the same day as the original determination. The need to include a modification of a project wage determination for the primary site of the work in a solicitation is determined by the time of receipt of the modification by the contracting agency. Therefore, the contracting agency must annotate the modification of the project wage determination with the date and time immediately upon receipt.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The need for inclusion of the modification of a general wage determination for the primary site of the work in a solicitation is determined by the date the modified wage determination is published on the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em>, or by the date the agency receives actual written notice of the modification from the Department of Labor, whichever occurs first. (Note the distinction between receipt by the agency (modification is effective) and receipt by the contracting officer, which may occur later.) During the course of the solicitation, the contracting officer must monitor the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> website to determine whether the applicable wage determination has been revised. Revisions published on the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> website or otherwise communicated to the contracting officer within the timeframes prescribed at 22.403(b) and (c) are applicable and must be included in the resulting contract. Monitoring can be accomplished by use of the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> website's “Alert Service”.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The following applies when contracting by sealed bidding:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A written action modifying a wage determination must be effective if:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> It is received by the contracting agency, or is published on the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em>, 10 or more calendar days before the date of bid opening; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> It is received by the contracting agency, or is published on the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em>, less than 10 calendar days before the date of bid opening, unless the contracting officer finds that there is not reasonable time available before bid opening to notify the prospective bidders. (If the contracting officer finds that there is not reasonable time to notify bidders, a written report of the finding must be placed in the contract file and must be made available to the Department of Labor upon request.)</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> All written actions modifying wage determinations received by the contracting agency after bid opening, or modifications to general wage determinations published on the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> after bid opening, shall not be effective and shall not be included in the solicitation (but see paragraph (b)(6) of this section).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> If an effective modification of the wage determination for the primary site of the work is received by the contracting officer before bid opening, the contracting officer must postpone the bid opening, if necessary, to allow a reasonable time to amend the solicitation to incorporate the modification and permit bidders to amend their bids. If the modification does not change the wage rates and would not warrant amended bids, the contracting officer must amend the solicitation to include the number and date of the modification.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> If an effective modification of the wage determination for the primary site of the work is received by the contracting officer after bid opening, but before award, the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> award the contract, incorporate the new determination to be effective on the date of contract award, and equitably adjust the contract price for any increased or decreased cost of performance resulting from any changed wage rates;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> award the contract and modify it to include the number and date of the new determination, if the new determination for the primary site of the work does not change any wage rates; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> cancel the solicitation, but only in accordance with 14.404-1.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> If an effective modification is received by the contracting officer after award, the contracting officer must modify the contract to incorporate the wage modification retroactive to the date of award and equitably adjust the contract price for any increased or decreased cost of performance resulting from any changed wage rates. If the modification does not change any wage rates and would not warrant contract price adjustment, the contracting officer must modify the contract to include the number and date of the modification.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> If an award is not made within 90 days after bid opening, any modification to a general wage determination which is published on the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> before award, shall be effective for any resultant contract unless an extension of the 90-day period is obtained from the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division. An agency head may request such an extension from the Administrator. The request must be supported by a written finding, which must include a brief statement of factual support, that the extension is necessary and proper in the public interest to prevent injustice, undue hardship, or to avoid serious impairment in the conduct of Government business. The contracting officer must follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The following applies when contracting by negotiation:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> All written actions modifying wage determinations received by the contracting agency before contract award, or modifications to general wage determinations published on the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> before award, shall be effective.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If an effective wage modification is received by the contracting officer before award, the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> If the new determination for the primary site of the work changes any wage rates, amend the solicitation to incorporate the new determination and furnish the wage rate information to all prospective offerors that were sent a solicitation if the closing date for receipt of proposals has not yet occurred, or to all offerors that have not been eliminated from the competition if the closing date has passed. All offerors to whom wage rate information has been furnished must be given reasonable opportunity to amend their proposals; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If the new determination for the primary site of the work does not change any wage rates, amend the solicitation to include the number and date of the new determination and award the contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> If an effective wage modification is received by the contracting officer after award, the contracting officer must follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> If a solicitation is amended after issuance to add the wage determination for the primary site of the work (see 22.402-3(c))—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> In sealed bidding, bids may not be opened until a reasonable time after the wage determination for the primary site of the work has been furnished to all bidders.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> In negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer may open proposals and conduct negotiations before obtaining the wage determination for the primary site of the work. However, the contracting officer must incorporate the wage determination for the primary site of the work into the solicitation before submission of best and final offers.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> The following written notifications by the Department of Labor must be effective immediately if received by the contracting officer prior to award:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A wage determination found to contain clerical errors;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> A solicitation includes the wrong wage determination or the wrong rate schedule; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> A wage determination is withdrawn by the Administrative Review Board.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> For appealing a denial of reconsideration of a wage determination see 22.402-3(e).</p></div>
