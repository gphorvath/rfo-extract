<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Periodic revisions to</em> <em class="ph i">wage determinations by DOL</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The Wage and Hour Administrator may issue revisions to prevailing wage determinations periodically. The need for inclusion of a revised prevailing wage determination in a solicitation is determined by the date of receipt of the revised prevailing wage determination by the contracting agency. (Note the distinction between receipt by the agency and receipt by the contracting officer which may occur later.)</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> For purposes of using Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em>, the time of receipt by the contracting agency must be the first day of publication of the revised prevailing wage determination on the website.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> For purposes of using the e98 process, the time of receipt by the contracting agency must be the date the agency receives actual notice of a new or revised prevailing wage determination from the Department of Labor as an e98 response.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> In selecting a prevailing wage determination from the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> website for use in a solicitation or other contract action, the contracting officer must monitor the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> website to determine whether the applicable wage determination has been revised. Revisions published on the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> website or otherwise communicated to the contracting officer within the timeframes prescribed at paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section are effective and must be included in the resulting contract. Monitoring can be accomplished by use of the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> website's “Alert Service”.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The following must apply when contracting by sealed bidding: a revised prevailing wage determination shall not be effective if it is received by the contracting agency less than 10 days before the opening of bids, and the contracting officer finds that there is not reasonable time to incorporate the revision in the solicitation.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, a revised prevailing wage determination received by the contracting agency after award of a new contract or a modification as specified in 22.1004-1(c) shall not be effective provided that the start of performance is within 30 days of the award or the specified modification. If the contract does not specify a start of performance date which is within 30 days of the award or the specified modification, and if contract performance does not commence within 30 days of the award or the specified modification, any revision received by the contracting agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the work shall be effective.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> If the contracting officer has submitted an e98 to the Department of Labor requesting a prevailing wage determination and has not received a response within 10 days, the contracting officer must contact the Wage and Hour Division by telephone to determine when the wage determination can be expected. (The telephone number is provided on the e98 website.)</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Wage determinations based on collective bargaining agreements</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> In sealed bidding, a new or changed collective bargaining agreement shall not be effective under 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) if the contracting agency has received notice of the terms of the new or changed collective bargaining agreement less than 10 days before bid opening and the contracting officer determines that there is not reasonable time to incorporate the new or changed terms of the collective bargaining agreement in the solicitation.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, a new or changed collective bargaining agreement shall not be effective under 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) if notice of the terms of the new or changed collective bargaining agreement is received by the contracting agency after award of a successor contract or a modification as specified in 22.1004-1(c), provided that the contract start of performance is within 30 days of the award of the contract or of the specified modification. If the contract does not specify a start of performance date which is within 30 days of the award of the contract or of the specified modification, or if contract performance does not commence within 30 days of the award of the contract or of the specified modification, any notice of the terms of a new or changed collective bargaining agreement received by the agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the work must be effective for purposes of the successor contract under 41 U.S.C. 6707(c).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The limitations in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section must apply only if timely notification required in 22.1004-6 has been given.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> If the c ontracting officer has submitted an e98 to Department of Labor requesting a wage determination based on a collective bargaining agreement and has not received a response from the Department of Labor within 10 days, the contracting officer must contact the Wage and Hour Division by telephone to determine when the wage determination can be expected. (The telephone number is provided on the e98 website.) If the Department of Labor is unable to provide the wage determination by the latest date needed to maintain the acquisition schedule, the contracting officer must incorporate the collective bargaining agreement itself in a solicitation or other contract action (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, exercise of option) and include a wage determination referencing that collective bargaining agreement created by use of the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> website.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Delays</em>. If a wage determination was obtained through the e98 process, and bid opening has been delayed, for whatever reason, more than 60 days from the date indicated on the previously submitted e98, the contracting officer must submit a new e98. Any revision of a wage determination received by the contracting agency as a result of that communication must supersede the earlier response as the wage determination applicable to the particular acquisition subject to the time frames in 22.1003(a)(3) and (4).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Notification to contractors and employees</em>. The contracting officer must take the following steps to ensure that service employees are notified of minimum wages and fringe benefits.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> At the time of award, furnish the contractor Department of Labor Publication WH-1313, Notice to Employees Working on Government Contracts, for posting at a prominent and accessible place at the worksite before contract performance begins. The publication advises employees of the compensation (wages and fringe benefits) required to be paid or furnished under the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and satisfies the notice requirements in paragraph (g) of the clause at 52.222-41, Service Contract Labor Standards.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Attach any applicable wage determination to Publication WH-1313.</p></div>
