<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Policy.</em> Contracting agencies are responsible for ensuring the full and impartial enforcement of labor standards in the administration of construction contracts. Contracting agencies must maintain an effective program that must include—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Ensuring that contractors and subcontractors are informed, before commencement of work, of their obligations under the labor standards clauses of the contract;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Adequate payroll reviews, on-site inspections, and employee interviews to determine compliance by the contractor and subcontractors, and prompt initiation of corrective action when required;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Prompt investigation and disposition of complaints; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Prompt submission of all reports required by the regulations on labor standards for contracts involving construction in this part.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Compliance checking.</em> The contracting officer must make checks and investigations on all contracts covered by this subpart as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the labor standards requirement of the contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Regular compliance checks.</em> Regular compliance checking includes the following activities:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Employee interviews to determine correctness of classifications, rates of pay, fringe benefits payments, and hours worked. (See Standard Form 1445.)</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> On-site inspections to check type of work performed, number and classification of workers, and fulfillment of posting requirements.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Payroll reviews to ensure that payrolls of prime contractors and subcontractors have been submitted on time and are complete and in compliance with contract requirements.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Comparison of the information in this paragraph (b) with available data, including daily inspector's report and daily logs of construction, to ensure consistency.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Special compliance checks.</em> Situations that may require special compliance checks include—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Inconsistencies, errors, or omissions detected during regular compliance checks; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Receipt of a complaint alleging violations. If the complaint is not specific enough, the complainant must be so advised and invited to submit additional information.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Investigations</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Contracting agency investigations</em>. Contracting agencies must conduct an investigation when a compliance check indicates that substantial or willful violations may have occurred or violations have not been corrected.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The investigation must—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Include all aspects of the contractor's compliance with contract labor standards requirements;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Not be limited to specific areas raised in a complaint or uncovered during compliance checks; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> Use personnel familiar with labor laws and their application to contracts.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Do not disclose contractor employees' oral or written statements taken during an investigation or the employee's identity to anyone other than an authorized Government official without that employee's prior signed consent.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Send a written request to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, to obtain—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Investigation and enforcement instructions; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Available pertinent Department of Labor files.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Obtain permission from the Department of Labor before disclosing material obtained from Labor Department files, other than computations of back wages and liquidated damages and summaries of back wages due, to anyone other than Government contract administrators.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> The contracting officer must review the investigation report on receipt and make preliminary findings. The contracting officer normally must not base adverse findings solely on employee statements that the employee does not wish to have disclosed. However, if the investigation establishes a pattern of possible violations that are based on employees' statements that are not authorized for disclosure, the pattern itself may support a finding of noncompliance.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vi)</span> After completing the review, the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Provide the contractor any written preliminary findings and proposed corrective actions, and notice that the contractor has the right to request that the basis for the findings be made available and to submit written rebuttal information.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Upon request, provide the contractor with rationale for the findings. However, under no circumstances will the contracting officer permit the contractor to examine the investigation report. Also, the contracting officer must not disclose the identity of any employee who filed a complaint or who was interviewed, without the prior consent of the employee.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span></p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>(<em class="ph i">1</em>) The contractor may rebut the findings in writing within 60 days after it receives a copy of the preliminary findings. The rebuttal becomes part of the official investigation record. If the contractor submits a rebuttal, evaluate the preliminary findings and notify the contractor of the final findings.</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>(<em class="ph i">2</em>) If the contracting officer does not receive a timely rebuttal, the contracting officer must consider the preliminary findings final.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(D)</span> If appropriate, request the contractor to make restitution for underpaid wages and assess liquidated damages. If the request includes liquidated damages, the request must state that the contractor has 60 days to request relief from such assessment.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vii)</span> After taking the actions prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1)(v) and (c)(1)(vi) of this subsection—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> The contracting officer must prepare and forward a report of any violations, including findings and supporting evidence, to the agency head. Standard Form 1446, Labor Standards Investigation Summary Sheet, is the first page of the report; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The agency head must process the report as follows:</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>(<em class="ph i">1</em>) The contracting officer must send a detailed enforcement report to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, within 60 days after completion of the investigation, if—</p><p class="ListL6"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span>(<em class="ph i">i</em>) A contractor or subcontractor underpaid by $1,000 or more;</p><p class="ListL6"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span>(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) The contracting officer believes that the violations are aggravated or willful (or there is reason to believe that the contractor has disregarded its obligations to employees and subcontractors under the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute);</p><p class="ListL6"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span>(<em class="ph i">iii</em>) The contractor or subcontractor has not made restitution; or</p><p class="ListL6"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span>(<em class="ph i">iv</em>) Future compliance has not been assured.</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>(<em class="ph i">2</em>) If the Department of Labor expressly requested the investigation and none of the conditions in paragraph (c)(1)(vii)(B)(<em class="ph i">1</em>) of this subsection exist, submit a summary report to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division. The report must include—</p><p class="ListL6"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span>(<em class="ph i">i</em>) A summary of any violations;</p><p class="ListL6"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span>(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) The amount of restitution paid;</p><p class="ListL6"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span>(<em class="ph i">iii</em>) The number of workers who received restitution;</p><p class="ListL6"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span>(<em class="ph i">iv</em>) The amount of liquidated damages assessed under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute;</p><p class="ListL6"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span>(<em class="ph i">v</em>) Corrective measures taken; and</p><p class="ListL6"><span class="ph autonumber">(vi)</span>(<em class="ph i">vi</em>) Any information that may be necessary to review any recommendations for an appropriate adjustment in liquidated damages.</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>(<em class="ph i">3</em>) If none of the conditions in paragraphs (c)(1)(vii)(B)(<em class="ph i">1</em>) or (<em class="ph i">2</em>) of this subsection are present, close the case and retain the report in the appropriate contract file.</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span>(<em class="ph i">4</em>) If substantial evidence is found that violations are willful and in violation of a criminal statute, (generally 18 U.S.C. 874 or 1001), forward the report (supplemented if necessary) to the Attorney General of the United States for prosecution if the facts warrant. Notify the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, when the report is forwarded for the Attorney General's consideration.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Department of Labor investigations.</em> The Department of Labor will furnish the contracting officer an enforcement report detailing violations found and any corrective action taken by the contractor, in investigations that disclose—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Underpayments totaling $1,000 or more;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Aggravated or willful violations (or, when the contracting officer believes that the contractor has disregarded its obligations to employees and subcontractors under the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute); or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Potential assessment of liquidated damages under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> <em class="ph i">Other investigations.</em> The Department of Labor will provide a letter summarizing the findings of the investigation to the contracting officer for all investigations that are not described in paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> <em class="ph i">Cooperation</em>.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contracting agency must cooperate with representatives of the Department of Labor in the inspection of records, interviews with workers, and all other aspects of investigations undertaken by the Department of Labor.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> When requested, the contracting agency must furnish to the Secretary any available information on contractors, subcontractors, current and previous contracts, and the nature of the contract work.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> If a Department of Labor representative undertakes an investigation at a construction project, the contracting officer must inquire into the scope of the investigation, and request to be notified immediately of any violations discovered under the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute, the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute, or the Copeland (Anti-Kickback) Act.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Report</em>. A semiannual report on compliance with and enforcement of the construction labor standards requirements of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute and Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute is required from each contracting agency. The reporting periods are October 1 through March 31 and April 1 through September 30. The reports must only contain information as to the enforcement actions of the contracting agency and must be prepared as prescribed in Department of Labor memoranda and submitted to the Department of Labor within 30 days after the end of the reporting period. This report has been assigned interagency report control number 1482-DOL-SA.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Withholding payment</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> If the contractor fails to submit copies of its or its subcontractors' payrolls promptly under clause 52.222-8, the contracting officer must, from any payment due to the contractor, from any current Federal contract or Federally assisted contract with the same prime contractor that is subject to either the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute or Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute requirements, withhold approval of an amount that the contracting officer considers necessary to protect the interest of the Government and the employees of the contractor or any subcontractor.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span></p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> If the contracting officer believes a violation exists (see paragraph (a) of this subsection), or upon request of the Department of Labor, the contracting officer must withhold from payments due the contractor an amount equal to the estimated wage underpayment and estimated liquidated damages due the United States under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute. (See 22.302.)</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Use withheld funds as provided in paragraph (g) of this subsection to satisfy assessed liquidated damages, and unless the contractor makes restitution, validated wage underpayments.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> <em class="ph i">Suspension of contract payments.</em> If a contractor or subcontractor fails or refuses to comply with the labor standards clauses of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute and related statutes, the agency, upon its own action or upon the written request of the Department of Labor, must suspend any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds until the violations cease or until the agency has withheld sufficient funds to compensate employees for back wages, and to cover any liquidated damages due.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> <em class="ph i">Disposition of contract payments withheld or suspended</em> —</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Forwarding wage underpayments to the Secretary.</em> Upon final administrative determination, if the contractor or subcontractor has not made restitution, the contracting officer must follow the Department of Labor guidance published in Wage and Hour Division, All Agency Memorandum (AAM) No. 215, Streamlining Claims for Federal Contractor Employees Act.
