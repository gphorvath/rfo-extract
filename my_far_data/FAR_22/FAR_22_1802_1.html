                <h2>22.1802-1 Policy.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> This subpart prescribes policies and procedures requiring contractors to utilize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Citizenship and Immigration Service's employment eligibility verification program (E-Verify) as the means for verifying employment eligibility of certain employees.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Statutes and Executive orders require employers to abide by the immigration laws of the United States and to employ in the United States only individuals who are eligible to work in the United States. The E-Verify program provides an Internet-based means of verifying employment eligibility of workers employed in the United States, but is not a substitute for any other employment eligibility verification requirements.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Contracting officers must include in solicitations and contracts, as prescribed in 22.1802-2, requirements that Federal contractors must—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Enroll as Federal contractors in E-Verify;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Use E-Verify to verify employment eligibility of all new hires working in the United States, except that the contractor may choose to verify only new hires assigned to the contract if the contractor is—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> An institution of higher education (as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a));</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> A State or local government or the government of a Federally recognized Indian tribe; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> A surety performing under a takeover agreement entered into with a Federal agency pursuant to a performance bond;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Use E-Verify to verify employment eligibility of all employees assigned to the contract; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Include these requirements, as required by the clause at 52.222-54, in subcontracts for—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Services, except for commercial services that are part of the purchase of a COTS item (or an item that would be a COTS item, but for minor modifications), performed by the COTS provider, and are normally provided for that COTS item; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Construction.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Contractors may elect to verify employment eligibility of all existing employees working in the United States who were hired after November 6, 1986 (after November 27, 2009, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), instead of just those employees assigned to the contract. The contractor is not required to verify employment eligibility of—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Employees who hold an active security clearance of confidential, secret, or top secret; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Employees for whom background investigations have been completed and credentials issued pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> In exceptional cases, the head of the contracting activity may waive the E-Verify requirement for a contract or subcontract or a class of contracts or subcontracts, either temporarily or for the period of performance. This waiver authority may not be delegated.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> DHS and the Social Security Administration (SSA) may terminate a contractor's memorandum of understanding (MOU) and deny access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the terms of the MOU. If DHS or SSA terminates a contractor's MOU, the terminating agency must refer the contractor to a suspending and debarring official for possible suspension or debarment action. During the period between termination of the MOU and a decision by the suspending and debarring official whether to suspend or debar, the contractor is excused from its obligations under paragraph (b) of the clause at 52.222-54. If the contractor is suspended, debarred, or subject to a voluntary exclusion as a result of the MOU termination, the contractor is not eligible to participate in E-Verify during the period of its suspension, debarment, or voluntary exclusion. If the contractor is not suspended, debarred, or subject to a voluntary exclusion, then the contractor must reenroll in E-Verify.</p></div>
