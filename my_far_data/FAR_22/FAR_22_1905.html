<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Authority.</em></p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Section 5 of the E.O. grants the authority for investigating potential violations of, and obtaining compliance with, the E.O. to the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor, in promulgating the implementing regulations required by Section 4 of the E.O., has assigned this authority to the Administrator. Contracting agencies do not have authority to conduct compliance investigations under 29 CFR part 10 or part 23 as implemented in this subpart. This does not limit the contracting officer's authority to otherwise enforce the terms and conditions of the contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Contracting officers must withhold payment at the direction of the Administrator.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The contracting officer must withhold payment, without a request from the Administrator, if the contractor fails to comply with the requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of 52.222-55, Minimum Wages for Contractor Workers Under Executive Order 14026 to furnish payroll records, until such time as the noncompliance is corrected.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Complaints.</em></p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Complaints may be filed with the contracting officer or the Administrator by any person, entity, or organization that believes a violation of this subpart has occurred.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The identity of any individual who makes a written or oral statement as a complaint or in the course of an investigation, as well as portions of the statement which would reveal the individual's identity, must not be disclosed in any manner to anyone other than Federal officials without the prior consent of the individual, unless otherwise authorized by law.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Upon receipt of a complaint, or if notified that the Administrator has received a complaint, the contracting officer must report the following information, within 14 days, if available without conducting an investigation, to the Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Office of Government Contracts, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Room S3006, Washington, DC 20210.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The complaint or description of the alleged violation;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Available statements by the worker, contractor, or any other person regarding the alleged violation;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Evidence that clause 52.222-55, Minimum Wages for Contractor Workers Under Executive Order 14026, (or its predecessor for complaints under 29 CFR part 10) was included in the contract;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Information concerning known settlement negotiations between the parties, if applicable; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Any other relevant facts known to the contracting officer or other information requested by the Wage and Hour Division.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Investigations.</em> Complaints will be investigated by the Administrator, if warranted, in accordance with the procedures in 29 CFR part 23.430.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Remedies and sanctions</em> â€”</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Unpaid wages.</em> When the Administrator's investigation reveals that a contractor has failed to pay the applicable E.O. minimum wage, the Administrator will notify the contractor and the contracting agency of the unpaid wage violation, and request that the contractor remedy the violation. If the contractor does not remedy the violation, the Administrator may direct withholding of payments due on the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Federal Government. Upon final decision and direction of the Administrator, the contracting agency must transfer the withheld funds to the Department of Labor for disbursement in accordance with the procedures at 22.404-2.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Antiretaliation.</em> When a contractor has been found to have violated paragraph (i) of clause 52.222-55, Minimum Wages for Contractor Workers Under Executive Order 14026, the Administrator may provide for relief to the worker in accordance with 29 CFR 23.440.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> <em class="ph i">Debarment.</em></p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The Department of Labor may initiate debarment proceedings under 29 CFR 23.520 whenever a contractor is found to have disregarded its obligations under 29 CFR part 23.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Contracting officers must consider notifying the agency suspending and debarring official in accordance with agency procedures when a contractor commits significant violations of contract terms and conditions related to this subpart.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> <em class="ph i">Retroactive inclusion of contract clause.</em> If a contracting agency fails to include the contract clause in a contract to which E.O. 14026 applies, the contracting agency, on its own initiative or within 15 calendar days of notification by an authorized representative of the Department of Labor, must incorporate the contract clause in the contract retroactive to commencement of performance under the contract through the exercise of any and all authority that may be needed (including, where necessary, its authority to negotiate or amend, its authority to pay any necessary additional costs, and its authority under any contract provision authorizing changes, cancellation and termination).</p></div>
