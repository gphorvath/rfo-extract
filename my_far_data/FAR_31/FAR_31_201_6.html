<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Expressly unallowable costs or mutually agreed to be unallowable costs (including mutually agreed to be unallowable directly associated costs) must be identified and excluded from any billing, claim, or proposal applicable to a Government contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A directly associated cost is any cost that is generated solely as a result of incurring another cost, and that would not have been incurred had the other cost not been incurred.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> When an unallowable cost is incurred, its directly associated costs are also unallowable.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e15"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Costs that specifically become designated as unallowable or as unallowable directly associated costs of unallowable costs as a result of a written decision furnished by a contracting officer must be identified if included in or used in computing any billing, claim, or proposal applicable to a Government contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> This identification requirement also applies to any costs incurred for the same purpose under like circumstances as the costs specifically identified as unallowable under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"

and the presentation of unallowable costs must be in accordance with those described in 48 CFR 9904.405.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e33"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Statistical sampling is an acceptable practice for contractors to follow in accounting for and presenting unallowable costs, provided the following criteria are met:</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e39"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The statistical sampling results in an unbiased sample that is a reasonable representation of the sampling universe.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e44"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Any large dollar value or high risk transaction is separately reviewed for unallowable costs and excluded from the sampling process.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e49"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The statistical sampling permits audit verification.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e54"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> For any indirect cost in the selected sample that is subject to the penalty provisions at 42.709, the amount projected to the sampling universe from that sampled cost is also subject to the same penalty provisions.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e62"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Use of statistical sampling methods for identifying and segregating unallowable costs should be the subject of an advance agreement (see 31.110).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The advance agreement should specify the basic characteristics of the sampling process.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) or Federal official must request input from the cognizant auditor before entering into any such agreements.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e70"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> In the absence of an advance agreement, if an initial review of the facts results in a challenge of the statistical sampling methods by the contracting officer or the contracting officer’s representative, the burden of proof must be on the contractor to establish that such a method meets the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e75"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> If a directly associated cost is included in a cost pool that is allocated over a base that includes the unallowable cost with which it is associated, the directly associated cost must remain in the cost pool.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Since the unallowable costs will attract their allocable share of costs from the cost pool, no further action is required to assure disallowance of the directly associated costs.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> In all other cases, the directly associated costs, if material in amount, must be purged from the cost pool as unallowable costs.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e80"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e85"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> In determining the materiality of a directly associated cost, consideration should be given to the significance of the—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e91"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The actual dollar amount,</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e96"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The cumulative effect of all directly associated costs in a cost pool, and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e101"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The ultimate effect on the cost of Government contracts.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e106"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Salary expenses of employees who participate in activities that generate unallowable costs must be treated as directly associated costs to the extent of the time spent on the proscribed activity, provided the costs are material in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section (except when such salary expenses are unallowable).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The time spent on proscribed activities should be compared to total time spent on company activities to determine if the costs are material.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Time spent by employees outside the normal working hours should not be considered except when it is evident that an employee engages so frequently in company activities during periods outside normal working hours as to indicate that such activities are a part of the employee's regular duties.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_201_6__d1950e111"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> When a selected item of cost at 31.205 provides that directly associated costs be unallowable, such directly associated costs are unallowable only if determined to be material in amount in accordance with the criteria provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, except in those situations where allowance of any of the directly associated costs involved would be considered to be contrary to public policy.</p></div>
