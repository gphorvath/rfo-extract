Contingencies of this category are to be included in the estimates of future costs so as to provide the best estimate of performance cost.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_205_7__d1962e34"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Those that may arise from presently known or unknown conditions, the effect of which cannot be measured so precisely as to provide equitable results to the contractor and to the Government (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, results of pending litigation). Contingencies of this category are to be excluded from cost estimates under the several items of cost but should be disclosed separately (including the basis upon which the contingency is computed) to facilitate the negotiation of appropriate contractual coverage.
