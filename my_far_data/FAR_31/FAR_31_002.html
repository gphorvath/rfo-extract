<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">As used in this part—</p><p class="p"><em class="ph i _31.001d1930e18 Term">Accrued benefit cost method</em> means an actuarial cost method under which units of benefits are assigned to each cost accounting period and are valued as they accrue; i.e., based on the services performed by each employee in the period involved. The measure of normal cost under this method for each cost accounting period is the present value of the units of benefit deemed to be credited to employees for service in that period. The measure of the actuarial accrued liability at a plan's inception date is the present value of the units of benefit credited to employees for service prior to that date. (This method is also known as the unit credit cost method without salary projection.)</p><p class="p"><em class="ph i _31.001d1930e39 Term">Actual costs</em> means (except for subpart 31.6) amounts determined on the basis of costs incurred, as distinguished from forecasted costs. Actual costs include standard costs properly adjusted for applicable variances.</p><p class="p"><em class="ph i _31.001d1930e49 Term">Actuarial accrued liability</em> means pension cost attributable, under the actuarial cost method in use, to years prior to the current period considered by a particular actuarial valuation. As of such date, the actuarial accrued liability represents the excess of the present value of future benefits and administrative expenses over the present value of future normal costs for all plan participants and beneficiaries. The excess of the actuarial accrued liability over the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan is the unfunded actuarial liability. The excess of the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan over the actuarial accrued liability is an actuarial surplus and is treated as a negative unfunded actuarial liability.</p><p class="p"><em class="ph i _31.001d1930e55 Term">Actuarial assumption</em> means an estimate of future conditions affecting pension cost; <em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> mortality rate, employee turnover, compensation levels, earnings on pension plan assets, and changes in values of pension plan assets.</p><p class="p"><em class="ph i _31.001d1930e64 Term">Actuarial cost method</em> means a technique which uses actuarial assumptions to measure the present value of future pension benefits and pension plan administrative expenses, and that assigns the cost of such benefits and expenses to cost accounting periods.
