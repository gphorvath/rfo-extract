<div class="body conbody"><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> For contracts subject to full CAS coverage, allocation of indirect costs must be based on the applicable CAS regulations.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For all other contracts, paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section apply.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e15"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> After direct costs have been determined and charged directly to the contract or other work, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to intermediate or two or more final cost objectives.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> No final cost objective must have allocated to it as an indirect cost any cost, if other costs incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, have been included as a direct cost of that or any other final cost objective.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e20"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contractor must accumulate indirect costs by logical cost groupings with due consideration of the reasons for incurring such costs.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The contractor must determine each grouping so as to permit use of an allocation base that is common to all cost objectives to which the grouping is to be allocated.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The base selected must allocate the grouping on the basis of the benefits accruing to intermediate and final cost objectives.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> When substantially the same results can be achieved through less precise methods, the number and composition of cost groupings should be governed by practical considerations and should not unduly complicate the allocation.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e25"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Once an appropriate base for allocating indirect costs has been accepted, the contractor must not fragment the base by removing individual elements.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> All items properly includable in an indirect cost base must bear a pro rata share of indirect costs irrespective of their acceptance as Government contract costs (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, when a cost input base is used for the allocation of general and administrative (G&amp;A) costs, the contractor must include in the base all items that would properly be part of the cost input base, whether allowable or unallowable, and these items must bear their pro rata share of G&amp;A costs).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e30"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> The method of allocating indirect costs may require revision when there is a significant change in the nature of the business, the extent of subcontracting, fixed-asset improvement programs, inventories, the volume of sales and production, manufacturing processes, the contractorâ€™s products, or other relevant circumstances.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e35"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> Separate cost groupings for costs allocable to offsite locations may be necessary to permit equitable distribution of costs on the basis of the benefits accruing to the several cost objectives.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e40"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> A base period for allocating indirect costs is the cost accounting period during which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to work performed in that period.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e46"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> For contracts subject to full or modified CAS coverage, the contractor shall follow the criteria and guidance in 48 CFR 9904.406 for selecting the cost accounting periods to be used in allocating indirect costs.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e51"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The base period for allocating indirect costs must be the contractor's fiscal year used for financial reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The fiscal year will normally be 12 months, but a different period may be appropriate (e.g., when a change in fiscal year occurs due to a business combination or other circumstances).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e59"><span class="ph autonumber">(h)</span> Special care should be exercised in applying the principles of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section when Government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) plants are involved. The distribution of corporate, division or branch office G&amp;A expenses to such plants operating with little or no dependence on corporate administrative activities may require more precise cost groupings, detailed accounts screening, and carefully developed distribution bases.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_203__d1953e64"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Indirect costs that meet the definition of excessive pass-through charge in 52.215-23, are unallowable.</p></div>
