<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">Agencies must structure contracts to carefully balance payment terms and title rights to protect the Governmentâ€™s interests.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Contracts for dismantling or demolition may be structured so that either the Government pays the contractor for performing the work, or the contractor pays the Government for the right to salvage and remove the resulting materials.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The contracting officer must evaluate all salvageable property to determine its usefulness to the Government. When property is worth more to the Government than its salvage value to the contractor, the contract must specifically designate it for Government retention. For all other property, which the contractor will own, the contracting officer must determine its fair market value. This valuation affects both payment structure and any potential termination compensation.</p></div>
