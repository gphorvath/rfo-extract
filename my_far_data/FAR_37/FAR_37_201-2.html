<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>A personal services contract exists when the Government supervises or controls contractor employees, or appears to do so, as if they were Government employees. This type of contract circumvents civil service laws that require the Government to competitively hire and appoint its own employees.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>The Government exercising relatively continuous supervision and control over multiple contractor personnel is frequently a key indicator of a personal services contract. However, judgment is required because service contracts often involve interaction with contractor employees—such as ordering and reviewing specific work—that do not constitute the type of supervision or control that would convert a contractor employee into a Government employee.</p></div>
