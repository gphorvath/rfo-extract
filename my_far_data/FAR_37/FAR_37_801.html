<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">As used in this subpart—</p><p class="p"><em class="ph i _37.801d1e18 Term">Adjusted hourly rate </em>(including uncompensated overtime) is the rate that results from multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the proposed hours per week which includes uncompensated overtime hours over and above the standard 40-hour work week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20 per hour would be converted to an uncompensated overtime rate of $17.78 per hour ($20.00 × <em class="ph i">40/45 = $17.78).</em></p><p class="p"><em class="ph i _37.801d1e27 Term">Uncompensated overtime</em> means the hours worked without additional compensation in excess of an average of 40 hours per week by direct charge employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. Compensated personal absences such as holidays, vacations, and sick leave must be included in the normal work week for purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours.</p></div>
