The contracting officer's judgment need be formally documented only when a substantive issue concerning potential organizational conflict of interest exists.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_9_504__d631e47"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> The contracting officer must award the contract to the apparent successful offeror unless a conflict of interest is determined to exist that cannot be avoided or mitigated. Before determining to withhold award based on conflict of interest considerations, the contracting officer must notify the contractor, provide the reasons therefor, and allow the contractor a reasonable opportunity to respond. If the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with 9.503. The waiver request and decision must be included in the contract file.</p></div>
