<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_9_507_2__d640e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> If, as a condition of award, the contractor's eligibility for future prime contract or subcontract awards will be restricted or the contractor must agree to some other restraint, the solicitation must contain a proposed clause that specifies both the nature and duration of the proposed restraint. The contracting officer must include the clause in the contract, first negotiating the clause's final terms with the successful offeror, if it is appropriate to do so (see 9.506(d)).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_9_507_2__d640e18"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The restraint imposed by a clause must be limited to a fixed term of reasonable duration, sufficient to avoid the circumstance of unfair competitive advantage or potential bias. This period varies. It might end, for example, when the first production contract using the contractor's specifications or work statement is awarded, or it might extend through the entire life of a system for which the contractor has performed systems engineering and technical direction. In every case, the restriction must specify termination by a specific date or upon the occurrence of an identifiable event.</p></div>
