The contracting officer must obtain copies of these agreements and ensure that they are properly executed.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_9_505_4__d636e31"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Contractors also obtain proprietary and source selection information by acquiring the services of marketing consultants which, if used in connection with an acquisition, may give the contractor an unfair competitive advantage. Contractors should make inquiries of marketing consultants to ensure that the marketing consultant has provided no unfair competitive advantage.</p></div>
