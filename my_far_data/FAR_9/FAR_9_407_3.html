If the suspending and debarring official extends the opportunity for the contractor to submit material in opposition, then the official should also give a deadline for submission of materials. The suspending and debarring official may use the flexible procedures in 9.406-3(b)(1); if so, the suspending and debarring official should change the notice in paragraph (c)(5) of this section to include those flexible procedures.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_407_3__d621e28"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>In actions not based on an indictment, if the contractor's submission in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension and if no determination has been made, on the basis of Department of advice from the Department of Justice, a U.S. Attorney's office, State attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced, agencies must also—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_9_407_3__d621e34"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Afford the contractor an opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any person the agency presents; and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_9_407_3__d621e39"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Make a transcribed record of the proceedings and make it available at cost to the contractor upon request, unless the contractor and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a transcript.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_9_407_3__d621e44"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Notice of suspension</em>.
