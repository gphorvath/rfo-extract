<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_9_104_4__d548e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Generally, prospective prime contractors are responsible for determining the responsibility of their prospective subcontractors (but see 9.405 and 9.405-2 regarding debarred, ineligible, or suspended firms). Determinations of prospective subcontractor responsibility may affect determination of the prospective prime contractor's responsibility. Require a prospective contractor to provide written evidence of a proposed subcontractor's responsibility, as necessary to determine responsibility.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_9_104_4__d548e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> When in the Government's interest, the contracting officer may directly determine a prospective subcontractor's responsibility (e.g., when the prospective contract involves medical supplies, urgent requirements, or substantial subcontracting). Apply the same standards for prime contractor responsibility to determine subcontractor responsibility.</p></div>
