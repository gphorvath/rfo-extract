<div class="body conbody"><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)(1)</span> Before awarding a contract exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, review the performance and integrity information available in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), (available at <a href="https://www.cpars.gov">https://www.cpars.gov</a>, including FAPIIS information from the System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusions and the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e23"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>FAPIIS also identifies—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e32"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> An affiliate that is an immediate owner or subsidiary of the offeror, if any; and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e40"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> All predecessors of the offeror that held a Federal contract or grant within the last three years.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e48"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)(1)</span> When making a responsibility determination, consider all the information available through FAPIIS regarding the offeror and any immediate owner, predecessor, or subsidiary identified for that offeror in FAPIIS, as well as other past performance information on the offeror (see part 42).</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e61"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For evaluation of information available through FAPIIS relating to an affiliate of the offeror, see 9.104-3(c).</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e69"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> For source selection evaluations of past performance, see 15.305(a)(2). Use sound judgment in determining the weight and relevance of the information contained in FAPIIS and how it relates to the present acquisition.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e77"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Since FAPIIS may contain information on any of the offeror's previous contracts and information covering a 5-year period, some of that information might be irrelevant to a determination of present responsibility. For example, a prior administrative action such as debarment, suspension, voluntary exclusion, or administrative agreement, that has expired or otherwise been resolved, or information relating to contracts for completely different products or services, might be irrelevant.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e82"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span>Because FAPIIS is a database that provides information about prime contractors, the contracting officer posts information about a subcontractor, such as trafficking in persons violations, to the record of the prime contractor (see 42.1503(h)(1)(v)). The prime contractor may post in FAPIIS any mitigating factors. Consider any mitigating factors posted in FAPIIS by the prime contractor, such as degree of compliance by the prime contractor with the terms of FAR clause 52.222-50.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e93"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Upon obtaining relevant information from FAPIIS regarding criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Government contract; terminations for default or cause; determinations of nonresponsibility because the contractor does not have a satisfactory performance record or a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; or comparable information relating to a grant, unless the contractor has already been debarred, suspended, or has agreed to a voluntary exclusion—</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e99"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Promptly request from the offeror additional information to demonstrate the offeror's responsibility (but see 9.405); and</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e107"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>Notify, prior to proceeding with award, in accordance with agency procedures (see 9.406-3(a) and 9.407-3(a)), the agency official responsible for initiating debarment or suspension action, if the information appears appropriate for the official's consideration.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_9_104_6__d550e118"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Document the contract file for each contract exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold to indicate how the information in FAPIIS was considered in any responsibility determination, as well as the action that was taken as a result of the information. Document nonresponsibility determinations in FAPIIS in accordance with 9.105-2 (b)(2).</p></div>
