<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Identifying applicable FASCSA orders</em>. Whether FASCSA orders apply to a particular acquisition depends on the contracting office’s agency, the scope of the FASCSA order, the funding, and whether the requirement involves certain types of information systems (see the definition of “FASCSA order” at 40.201). The contracting officer must coordinate with the program office or requiring activity to identify the FASCSA order(s) that apply to the acquisition as follows:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Unless the program office or requiring activity instructs the contracting officer otherwise, FASCSA orders apply as follows:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Contracts awarded by civilian agencies will be subject to DHS FASCSA orders.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Contracts awarded by DoD will be subject to DoD FASCSA orders. See paragraph (e)(1) of 52.240-91, Security Prohibitions and Exclusions.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For acquisitions where the program office or the requiring activity instructs the contracting officer to select specific types of FASCSA orders, the contracting officer must select “yes” or “no” for each applicable type of FASCSA order. See paragraph (e)(1) of 52.240-91, Security Prohibitions and Exclusions, with its Alternate I.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, and multi-agency contracts specific procedures.</em></p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Applying FASCSA orders. An agency awarding this type of contract must apply FASCSA orders to the basic contract award. Ordering activity contracting officers may use this contract vehicle without taking further steps to identify applicable FASCSA orders in the order. The contracting officer awarding the basic contract would select “yes” for all FASCSA orders (i.e., “DHS FASCSA Order” “DoD FASCSA Order” and “DNI FASCSA Order”) (see paragraph (e)(1) of 52.240-91, Security Prohibitions and Exclusions, with its Alternate I). If the contracting officer becomes aware of a newly issued applicable FASCSA order, then the agency awarding the basic contract must modify the basic contract to remove any covered article, or any products or services produced or provided by a source, prohibited by the newly issued FASCSA order.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Interagency acquisitions. For an interagency acquisition (see subpart 17.5) where the funding agency differs from the awarding agency, the funding agency must determine the applicable FASCSA orders.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Updating the solicitation or contract for new FASCSA orders</em>. The contracting officer must update a solicitation or contract if the program office or requiring activity determines it needs to:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Amend the solicitation to include FASCSA orders in effect after the date the solicitation was issued but before contract award; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Modify the contract to include FASCSA orders issued after the date of contract award.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Any such modification should take place within a reasonable amount of time, but no later than 6 months from the program office or requiring activity’s determination.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If the contract is not modified within the time specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then the contract file must be documented giving the reason why the contract could not be modified within this timeframe.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Agency specific procedures</em>. The contracting officer must follow agency procedures for implementing FASCSA orders not identified in SAM.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Waivers</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> An executive agency required to comply with a FASCSA order may submit a request that the order or some of its provisions not apply to—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The agency;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Specific actions of the agency or a specific class of acquisitions;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Actions of the agency for a period of time before compliance with the order is practicable; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Other activities, as appropriate, that the requesting agency identifies.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> A request for waiver must be submitted by the executive agency in writing to the official that issued the order, unless other instructions for submission are provided by the applicable FASCSA order.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The request for waiver must provide the following information for the issuing official to review and evaluate the request, including—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Identification of the applicable FASCSA order;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> A description of the exception sought, including, if limited to only a portion of the order, a description of the order provisions from which an exception is sought;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The name or a description sufficient to identify the covered article or the product or service provided by a source that is subject to the order from which an exception is sought;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Compelling justification for why an exception should be granted, such as the impact of the order on the agency's ability to fulfill its mission-critical functions, or considerations related to the national interest, including national security reviews, national security investigations, or national security agreements;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Any alternative mitigations to be undertaken to reduce the risks addressed by the FASCSA order; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vi)</span> Any other information requested by the issuing official.</p></div>
