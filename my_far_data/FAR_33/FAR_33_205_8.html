Certain factors, however, may make the use of ADR inappropriate (see 5 U.S.C. 572(b)).</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_33_205_8__d2233e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Except for arbitration conducted according to the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADRA), (5 U.S.C. 571, et seq.), agencies have authority that is separate from that provided by the ADRA to use ADR procedures to resolve issues in controversy. Agencies may also choose to proceed under the authority and requirements of the ADRA.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_33_205_8__d2233e36"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>The objective of using ADR procedures is to increase the opportunity to relatively quickly and cheaply resolve an issue in controversy. Essential elements of ADR include—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>An issue in controversy;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Both parties choose to participate in the ADR process;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Both parties agree on alternative procedures and terms instead of formal litigation; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Officials of both parties who have the authority to resolve the issue in controversy choose to participate in the process.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_33_205_8__d2233e44"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> If the contracting officer rejects a contractor's request for ADR proceedings, the contracting officer must give the contractor a written explanation citing one or more of the conditions in 5 U.S.C. 572(b) or such other specific reasons that ADR procedures are inappropriate to resolve the dispute.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>If a contractor rejects a request for ADR see 52.233-1(g).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_33_205_8__d2233e49"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> ADR procedures may be used at any time that the contracting officer has authority to resolve the issue in controversy. If a claim has been submitted, ADR procedures may apply to all or a portion of the claim. When ADR procedures are used after a contracting officer has issued their final decision, the contracting officer’s use of ADR procedures does not alter any of the time limitations or procedural requirements for filing an appeal of the contracting officer's final decision. The use of ADR procedures does not constitute a reconsideration of the final decision.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_33_205_8__d2233e54"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> When appropriate, a neutral person may be used to help resolve the issue in controversy using the procedures the parties chose.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span>The confidentiality of ADR proceedings must be protected consistent with 5 U.S.C. 574.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_33_205_8__d2233e62"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_33_205_8__d2233e67"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A solicitation must not require arbitration as a condition of award, unless arbitration is otherwise required by law.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_33_205_8__d2233e72"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> An agreement to use arbitration must be in writing and must specify a maximum award that the arbitrator may issue, as well as any other conditions limiting the range of possible outcomes.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_33_205_8__d2233e77"><span class="ph autonumber">(h)</span> Binding arbitration, as an ADR procedure, may be agreed to only as specified in agency guidelines. Such guidelines must provide advice on the appropriate use of binding arbitration and when an agency has authority to settle an issue in controversy through binding arbitration.</p></div>
