However, the Disputes statute, at 41 U.S.C. 7103(g), authorizes agencies to require a contractor to continue contract performance according to the contracting officer's decision pending a final resolution of any claim arising under, or relating to, the contract.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span>A claim arising under a contract is a claim that can be resolved under a contract clause, other than the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes, that provides for the relief sought by the claimant. However, relief for such a claim can also be sought under the clause at 52.233-1.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span>A claim relating to a contract is a claim that cannot be resolved under a contract clause other than the clause at 52.233-1.
