<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_102__d2277e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General.</em> This paragraph prescribes procedures for the use of the broad agency announcement (BAA) with Peer or Scientific Review (see part 6) for the acquisition of basic and applied research, as well as that part of development not related to developing a specific system or hardware procurement. The BAA technique must only be used when meaningful proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches are reasonably expected.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_102__d2277e20"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The BAA, together with any supporting documents, must—</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_102__d2277e26"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Describe the agency’s research interest, either for an individual program requirement or for broadly defined areas of interest covering the full range of the agency’s requirements;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_102__d2277e31"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>Explain how proposals will be selected, the relative importance of each criteria, and the evaluation methodology;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_102__d2277e36"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Specify the proposal due date; and</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_102__d2277e41"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Contain clear instructions for preparing and submitting proposals.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_102__d2277e46"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Contracting officers must publicize the BAA through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) and, if authorized in accordance with part 5, may also be published in scientific, technical, or engineering periodicals, or other electronic platforms and communities used by the target audience. Publish the notice at least once per year.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_102__d2277e54"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Use a peer or scientific review process to evaluate proposals. Written evaluation reports are required for each proposal; however, proposals are not required to be evaluated against each other since they are responding to broad research areas rather than a common work statement.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_102__d2277e59"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> Proposals should be selected based on—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Technical merit;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Importance to agency programs; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Availability of funds.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_102__d2277e64"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> Contracting officers must consider cost realism and reasonableness to the extent appropriate.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> Contracting officers do not need to publish a synopsis under part 5 for individual contracts awarded through a BAA. The notice published pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section fulfills the synopsis requirement.</p></div>
