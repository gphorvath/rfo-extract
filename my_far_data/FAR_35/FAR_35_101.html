<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Reviewing too many R&amp;D proposals from unqualified sources wastes time and money for both industry and the Government. Therefore, contracting officers should first send solicitations only to sources with the technical qualifications to perform the research or development work. Technical personnel should recommend potential sources that appear qualified, based on—</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e16"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Present and past performance of similar work;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Professional stature and reputation;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e26"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Relative position in a particular field of endeavor;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e31"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Ability to obtain and maintain the necessary professional and technical capability, including facilities, to perform the work; and</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e36"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Other relevant factors.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e41"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Proposals must generally be solicited from technically qualified sources, including sources identified through synopses or other means of publicizing requirements. When soliciting all qualified sources is not practical, the contracting officer may select a reasonable number to solicit. To promote competition, the contracting officer must provide the solicitation to other apparently qualified sources.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e46"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Solicitations must require offerors to—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Describe their technical and management approach;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Identify any technical uncertainties;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Propose specific solutions to resolve uncertainties; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Propose any planned subcontracting of scientific or technical work.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e54"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Solicitations may require proposals to be organized with technical sections grouped together for efficient review by technical experts (see part 15). Both the solicitation process and proposal evaluation should be designed to reduce costs for both offerors and the Government.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e62"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> R&amp;D solicitations should include evaluation factors to identify the most technically competent offerors (see part 15) such as—</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e71"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The offeror’s understanding of the scope of the work;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e76"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The quality of the offerors approach proposed to meet the scientific and technical objectives, or the merit of the ideas or concepts presented.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e81"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The offeror’s access to qualified engineering, scientific, or other technical staff.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e86"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The offeror's experience is relevant.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e91"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Any innovative ideas the offeror proposes in the specific scientific or technical field.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e96"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> The offeror’s access to the necessary research, testing, laboratory, or shop facilities.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e101"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> Besides technical evaluation factors, the contracting officer must also consider management capability, as appropriate, including—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Management capabilities, including cost control methods;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Experience and past performance;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Subcontracting practices; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Any other significant evaluation criteria (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, unrealistically low cost estimates in proposals for cost-reimbursement or fixed-price incentive contracts.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e109"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> Although cost or price is not usually the deciding factor in selecting a contractor to perform R&amp;D, it remains important. The final selection should be the offer that best satisfies the Government's requirement at a fair and reasonable cost.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e117"><span class="ph autonumber">(h)</span>The contracting officer should ensure potential offerors completely understand the details of the work, especially the Government interpretation of the work statement. For complex requirements, the contracting officer should give potential offerors a chance to comment on the details of the requirements as contained in the work statement, the contract schedule, and any related specifications. This may be done at a preproposal conference (see part 15).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e125"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> When appropriate, solicitations should allow offerors to propose an alternative contract type (see part 16).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_35_101__d2268e133"><span class="ph autonumber">(j)</span> When a potential contractor wants to discuss a new idea or product based on their privately-funded independent R&amp;D work, Government personnel should be willing to discuss it. However, the potential contractor must be informed that these discussions do not create any obligation for the Government. In such situations, direct negotiation with the potential contractor without competition may be appropriate. Also refer to part 15 regarding unsolicited proposals.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(k)</span> The Government may issue an exploratory request to identify existing ideas or prior work in a specific field of research. Any such request must clearly state that it does not impose any obligation on the Government or signify a firm intention to enter into a contract.</p></div>
