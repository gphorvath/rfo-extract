                <h2>35.402Policy.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> This section explains Federal policy on establishing, using, reviewing, and terminating Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and related sponsoring agreements.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> An FFRDC meets special long-term research or development needs that cannot be met as effectively by existing Government or contractor resources. FFRDCs allow agencies to use private sector resources for work integral to the agency’s mission. To fulfill its responsibilities, an FFRDC has special access to—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Government and supplier data, including sensitive and proprietary information;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Government employees; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Government facilities, equipment, and real property.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The FFRDC must—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Conduct business appropriately considering its special relationship with the Government;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Be free of organizational conflicts of interest; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Fully disclose its affairs to the sponsoring agency.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> FFRDCs must not use their privileged access to information or facilities to compete with the private sector. However, an FFRDC may perform work for agencies other than its sponsor under the Economy Act or other applicable laws when the work is not otherwise available from the private sector.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> FFRDCs are operated, managed, and/or administered by—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A university or consortium of universities;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> A nonprofit organization; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> An industrial firm, as an autonomous organization or as an identifiable separate operating unit of a parent organization.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> Long-term relationships between the Government and FFRDCs are encouraged to provide the continuity that attracts high-quality personnel. This relationship should help the FFRDC stay current in its field(s) of expertise, maintain its objectivity and independence, understand its sponsor’s needs, and provide a quick response capability.</p></div>
