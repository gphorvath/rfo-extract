L. 85-804 shall be accomplished as expeditiously as practicable, consistent with the care, restraint, and exercise of sound judgment appropriate to the use of such extraordinary authority.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_50_101_2__d2985e31"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Certain kinds of relief previously available only under Pub. L. 85-804; e.g., rescission or reformation for mutual mistake, are now available under the authority of 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes. The disputes process in part 33 must be followed before pursuing extraordinary contract relief under this part because the authority under Pub. L. 85-804 may not be relied upon when other adequate legal authority exists. The contracting officer should seek legal advice when unsure as to whether part 33 applies.</p></div>
