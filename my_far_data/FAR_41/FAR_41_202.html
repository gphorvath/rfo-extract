                <h2>41.202 Procedures.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>Agencies must conduct market surveys and perform acquisition planning in order to promote and provide for full and open competition provided that the contracting officer determines that any resultant contract would not be inconsistent with applicable state law governing the provision of electric utility services. If competition for an entire utility service is not available, the market survey may be used to determine the availability of competitive sources for certain portions of the requirement. The scope of the term “entire utility service” includes the provision of the utility service capacity, energy, water, sewage, transportation, standby or back-up service, transmission and/or distribution service, quality assurance, system reliability, system operation and maintenance, metering, and billing.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>In performing a market survey, the contracting officer must consider, in addition to alternative competitive sources, use of the following:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>GSA areawide contracts;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>Separate contracts; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>Interagency agreements.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>When a utility supplier refuses to execute a tendered contract, the agency must obtain a written definite and final refusal signed by a corporate officer or other responsible official of the supplier (or if unobtainable, document any unwritten refusal), and transmit this document, along with statements of the reasons for the refusal and the record of negotiations, to GSA at <a href="mailto:energy@gsa.gov">energy@gsa.gov</a>. Unless urgent and compelling circumstances exist, the contracting officer must notify GSA prior to acquiring utility services without executing a tendered contract. After such notification, the agency may proceed with the acquisition and pay for the utility service under the provisions of31 U.S.C. 1501(a)(8)—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>By issuing a purchase order; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>By ordering the necessary utility service and paying for it upon the presentation of an invoice, provided that a determination is approved by the head of the contracting activity that a written contract cannot be obtained and that the issuance of a purchase order is not feasible.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>When obtaining service without a bilateral written contract, the contracting officer must establish a utility history file on each acquisition of utility service provided by a contractor. This utility history file must contain the following information:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>The unsigned, tendered contract and any related letter of transmittal.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>The reasons stated by the utility supplier for not executing the tendered contract, the record of negotiations, and a written definite and final refusal by a corporate officer or other responsible official of the supplier (or if unobtainable, documentation of unwritten refusal).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>Services to be furnished and the estimated annual cost.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span>Historical record of any applicable connection charges.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span>Historical record of any applicable ongoing capital credits.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span>A copy of the applicable rate schedule.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>If the Government obtains utility service pursuant toparagraph (c) of this section, on an annual basis beginning from the date of final refusal, take action to execute a bilateral written contract. The contracting officer must document the utility history file with the efforts made and the agency must notify GSA, in writing at <a href="mailto:energy@gsa.gov">energy@gsa.gov</a>, if the utility continues to refuse to execute a bilateral contract.</p></div>
