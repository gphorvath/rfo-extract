Copies of the modification containing the approved rate change must be sent to the agency's paying office or office responsible for verifying billed amounts.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> If the utility supplier is not regulated and the rates, terms, and conditions of service are subject to negotiation pursuant to the clause at 52.241-8, Change in Rates or Terms and Conditions of Service for Unregulated Services, any rate change must be made a part of the contract by contract modification, with copies sent to the agency's paying office or office responsible for verifying billed amounts.</p></div>
