<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Termination for convenience clauses in 52.249 (except short-form clauses) require prime contractors to assign to the Government all rights, titles, and interests under any subcontract terminated because of prime contract termination. The TCO directs this assignment. The TCO must not require assignment unless it benefits the Government.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Termination for convenience clauses (except short-form clauses) also give the Government the right to settle and pay any settlement proposal from a subcontract termination at its discretion. This right does not obligate the Government to settle and pay subcontractor settlement proposals. Generally, the prime contractor must settle and pay these proposals. However, when the TCO determines it benefits the Government, the TCO must settle the subcontractor's proposal using prime contract settlement procedures after notifying the contractor (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, when a subcontractor is the only source and a delay by the prime contractor in settlement or payment would hurt the subcontractor's financial position). Direct settlements with subcontractors are not encouraged.</p></div>
