Audit reports are advisory only. The TCO uses them for negotiating settlements or making unilateral determinations. Government personnel handling audit reports must be careful not to reveal privileged information that could hurt the negotiation position of the Government, prime contractor, or higher-tier subcontractor. When appropriate and in the Government's best interest, the TCO may give audit reports to prime contractors and higher-tier subcontractors for settling subcontract proposals.</p></div>
