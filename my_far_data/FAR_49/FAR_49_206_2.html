With this approach, the contractor may propose only costs allocable to the terminated portion of the contract. The settlement proposal must separately list—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e22"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Metals, raw materials, purchased parts, work in process, finished parts, components, dies, jigs, fixtures, and tooling, at purchase or manufacturing cost;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e27"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Charges such as engineering costs, initial costs, and general administrative costs;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e32"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Costs of settlements with subcontractors;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e37"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Settlement expenses; and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e42"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Other proper charges.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e47"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> An allowance for profit (49.202) or adjustment for loss (49.203(b)) must be added to complete the gross settlement proposal. All unliquidated advance and progress payments and all disposal and other known credits must then be subtracted.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e58"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>The inventory basis is also appropriate for—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e64"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The partial termination of a construction or related professional services contract.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e69"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The partial or complete termination of supply orders under any terminated construction contract.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e74"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Complete termination of a unit-price professional services contract (not lump-sum contracts).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e79"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Total cost basis</em>.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e85"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> When the inventory basis is not practical or would cause delays, the total-cost basis (SF 1436) may be used if the TCO approves it in advance. Examples include the following—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e94"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> When production has not started and costs represent planning, preproduction, or "get ready" expenses.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e99"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> When the contractor's accounting system cannot easily establish unit costs for work in process and finished products.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e104"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> When the contract does not specify unit prices.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e109"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> When the termination is complete and involves a letter contract.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e114"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For a complete termination using the total-cost basis, the contractor must itemize costs incurred under the contract up to the effective date of termination. The costs of settlements with subcontractors and applicable settlement expenses must also be added. An allowance for profit or adjustment for loss must be made. The contract price for all end items delivered or to be delivered and accepted must be deducted. All unliquidated advance and progress payments and known disposal and other credits must also be deducted.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e125"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> For a partial termination using the total-cost basis, the contractor must wait until completing the continued portion of the contract before submitting the proposal. The proposal must follow paragraph (b)(2) instructions, except it must include all costs incurred up to the completion of the continued portion.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e130"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> For a completely terminated construction contract or lump-sum professional services contract, the contractor must—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e136"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Use the total cost basis of settlement;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e141"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Omit Line 10 "Deduct-Finished Product Invoiced or to be Invoiced" from Section II of SF 1436 Settlement Proposal (Total Cost Basis); and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e149"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Reduce the gross settlement amount by the total of all progress and other payments.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_206_2__d2914e154"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Other basis.</em> Settlement proposals cannot be submitted on any basis other than paragraph (a) or (b) of this section without prior approval from the chief of the contracting or contract administration office.</p></div>
