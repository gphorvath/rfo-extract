<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_5__d2886e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> When a subcontractor obtains a final judgment against a prime contractor, the TCO must treat the judgment amount as a cost of settling with the contractor. This applies to the extent the judgment is properly allocable to the terminated portion of the prime contract, if these conditions are met:</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_5__d2886e16"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The prime contractor made reasonable efforts to include in the subcontract a termination clause described in 49.502(e), 49.503(c), or a similar clause that excludes payment of anticipatory profits or consequential damages.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_5__d2886e27"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The subcontract provisions about termination rights of both parties are fair and reasonable and do not unreasonably increase the subcontractor's common law rights.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_5__d2886e32"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The contractor made reasonable efforts to settle the subcontractor's settlement proposal.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_5__d2886e37"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The contractor promptly notified the contracting officer when the proceedings that led to the judgment began and did not refuse to give the Government control of the defense.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_5__d2886e42"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> The contractor defended the suit diligently or, if the Government took control of the defense, provided reasonable assistance when requested.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_5__d2886e47"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> If not all conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section are met, the TCO may allow the contractor the part of the judgment considered fair for settling the subcontract proposal. The TCO must consider the policies in this part for settlement proposals.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_5__d2886e52"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> When a contractor and subcontractor submit the subcontractor's settlement proposal to arbitration under any applicable law or contract provision, the TCO must recognize the arbitration award as the cost of settling the contractor's proposal. This applies to the same extent and under the same conditions as in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p></div>
