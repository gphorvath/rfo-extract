<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_110__d2898e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The TCO must, at the conclusion of negotiations, prepare a settlement negotiation memorandum describing the principal elements of the settlement for inclusion in the termination case file and for use by reviewing authorities. Pricing aspects of the settlement must be documented, and memorandum distributed, both in accordance with part 15.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_110__d2898e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> If the settlement was negotiated on the basis of individual items, the TCO must specify the factors considered for each item. If the settlement was negotiated on an overall lump-sum basis, the TCO need not evaluate each item or group of items individually but must support the total amount of the recommended settlement in reasonable detail. The memorandum must include explanations of matters involving differences and doubtful questions settled by agreement, and the factors considered. The TCO should include any other matters that will assist reviewing authorities in understanding the basis for the settlement.</p></div>
