<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_109_7__d2897e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General.</em> If the contractor and TCO cannot agree on a termination settlement, or if a settlement proposal is not submitted within the period required by the termination clause, the TCO must issue a determination of the amount due. This determination must be consistent with the termination clause, including any cost principles incorporated by reference. The TCO must comply with 49.109-1 through 49.109-6 in making a settlement by determination and with 49.203 in making an adjustment for loss, if any.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_109_7__d2897e26"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Notice to contractor.</em> Before issuing a determination of the amount due the contractor, the TCO must give the contractor at least 15 days’ notice by certified mail (return receipt requested) to submit written evidence. The evidence must reach the TCO on or before a stated date and must support the amount previously proposed.</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_49_109_7__d2897e33"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span><em class="ph i"> Justification of settlement proposal</em>.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_49_109_7__d2897e39"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contractor has the burden of establishing the proposed amount by proof satisfactory to the TCO.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_109_7__d2897e44"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The contractor may submit vouchers, verified transcripts of books of account, affidavits, audit reports, and other documents as desired.

The transmittal letter must advise the contractor that the determination is a final decision from which the contractor may appeal under the Disputes clause, except as shown in paragraph (f) of this section. The determination must specify the amount due the contractor and will be supported by detailed schedules conforming generally to the forms for settlement proposals prescribed in 49.602-1 and by additional information, schedules, and analyses as appropriate. The TCO must explain each major item of disallowance. The TCO need not reconsider any other action relating to the terminated portion of the contract that was ratified or approved by the TCO or another contracting officer.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_109_7__d2897e85"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Preservation of evidence.</em> The TCO must retain all written evidence and other data relied upon in making a determination, except that copies of original books of account need not be made.

The pendency of an appeal will not affect the authority of the TCO to settle the settlement proposal or any part by negotiation with the contractor at any time before the appeal is decided.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_109_7__d2897e99"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> <em class="ph i">Decision on the contractor’s appeal.</em> The TCO must give effect to a decision of the Claims Court or a board of contract appeals, when necessary, by an appropriate modification to the contract. When appropriate, the TCO should obtain a release from the contractor. TCOs are authorized to modify the formats of settlement agreements in 49.603 to agree with this provision.</p></div>
