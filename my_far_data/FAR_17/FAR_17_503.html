<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Before placing an order for supplies or services with another Government agency, the requesting agency must follow the procedures in 17.502-1 and, if under the Economy Act, 17.502-2.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The order may be placed on any form or document that both agencies accept. The order should include—</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e27"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A description of the supplies or services required;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e32"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Delivery requirements;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e37"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> A funds citation;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e42"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> A payment provision (see 17.502-2(c) for Economy Act orders); and</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e50"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Acquisition authority as may be appropriate (see 17.503(d)).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e58"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The requesting and servicing agencies should agree to procedures for resolving disagreements that may arise under interagency acquisitions. When appropriate, this may include using a third-party forum. If a third party is proposed, that party should provide their written consent.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e63"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> When an interagency acquisition requires the servicing agency to award a contract, these additional procedures apply:</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e69"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> If law or regulation requires a justification and approval or a D&amp;F (other than the requesting agency's D&amp;F required in 17.502-2(c)), the servicing agency must prepare and issue it. The requesting agency must provide any information needed for the justification and approval or D&amp;F.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e77"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The requesting agency must provide other necessary assistance, such as information or special contract terms needed to comply with any conditions or limitations on the requesting agency's funds.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e82"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The servicing agency is responsible for compliance with all other legal or regulatory requirements for the contract, including—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e88"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Having proper legal authority for the contract action; and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e93"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Following all competition requirements in part 6. If the servicing agency is not subject to the FAR, the requesting agency must verify that contracts used to meet its requirements contain provisions protecting the Government from inappropriate charges (for example, provisions required by part 31). The requesting agency must also verify that adequate contract administration will be provided.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_17_503__d1098e107"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> Nonsponsoring Federal agencies may use a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) only if the terms of the FFRDC's sponsoring agreement allow work from agencies other than the sponsor. Work given to the FFRDC requires the sponsor's acceptance and must fall within the FFRDC's purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special expertise. (See part 35 and part 6 for procedures when using other than full and open competition.) The nonsponsoring agency must provide documentation to the sponsoring agency showing that the requested work would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with domestic private industry.</p></div>
