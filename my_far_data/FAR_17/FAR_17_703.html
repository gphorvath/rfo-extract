<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_17_703__d1106e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Effective performance under management and operating contracts typically requires high expertise levels and continuity in operations and personnel. Due to program requirements and the unusual or unique nature of work performed under these contracts, the Government often has limited ability to create competition or replace a contractor. Therefore, contracting officers must take extraordinary steps before award to ensure that—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The prospective contractor has sufficient technical and managerial capacity,</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Organizational conflicts of interest are adequately addressed; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The contract gives the Government broad and continuing rights to involve itself in technical and managerial decision making about performance, when necessary.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_17_703__d1106e15"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The contracting officer must review each management and operating contract, following agency procedures, at appropriate intervals and at least once every 5 years.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The review should determine if meaningful improvement in performance or cost might reasonably be achieved.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Any extension or renewal of a management and operating contract must be authorized at a level within the agency no lower than the level at which the original contract was authorized under 17.702-1.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_17_703__d1106e23"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Replacing an incumbent contractor is usually based largely on expectations of meaningful improvement in performance or cost.
