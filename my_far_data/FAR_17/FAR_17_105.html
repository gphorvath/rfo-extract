<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Termination vs. cancellation. The termination for convenience procedure applies to any Government contract, including multiyear contracts. Termination differs from cancellation in these ways:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Timing. Termination can occur anytime during the contract life, while cancellation happens between fiscal years.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Quantity. Termination can apply to total or partial quantities, while cancellation must apply to all quantities for future fiscal years.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Funding limitations upon termination. If funds are not available to continue a multiyear contract into the next fiscal year, the contract must be canceled or terminated. If the Government terminates the entire contract for convenience, including all cancellable requirements, the Government obligation is no more than:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The amount specified as available for contract performance; plus</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The applicable cancellation ceiling.</p></div>
