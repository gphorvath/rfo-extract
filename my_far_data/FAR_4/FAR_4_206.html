<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">Only contracting officers can sign contracts on behalf of the United States. The contracting officer's name and official title must be typed, stamped, or printed on the contract. The contracting officer normally signs the contract after the contractor has signed it. A digital signature using a certificate from the PIV or Common Access Card (CAC) assigned to the contracting officer is considered acceptable as a written signature.</p></div>
