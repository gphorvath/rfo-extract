<div class="body conbody"><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Transit arrangements permit the stopping of a carload or truckload shipment at a specific intermediate point en route to the final destination for storage, processing, or other purposes, as specified in carrier tariffs or rate tenders. A single through rate is charged from origin to final destination plus a transit or other related charge, rather than a more expensive combination of rates to and from the transit point.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Consider possible benefits available to the Government using existing transit arrangements or through efforts to obtain additional transit privileges from the carriers. Restrict solicitations incorporating transit arrangements to f.o.b. origin offers, because f.o.b. destination offers can only include fixed overall delivered prices at first destination.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Traffic management personnel must furnish information and analyses of situations in which transit arrangements might benefit the Government. The quantity awarded must entail sufficient tonnage to ensure the contractor can make carload/truckload shipments, and reasonable certainty should exist that carload/truckload quantities will ship upon request from the transit point.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Insert in solicitations the provision at 52.247-56, Transit Arrangements, when benefits <span class="ph" id="FAR_47_305_13___Hlk207287510">might </span>accrue to the Government because transit arrangements might apply.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> [Reserved]</p></div>
