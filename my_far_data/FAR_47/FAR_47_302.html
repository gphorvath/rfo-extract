<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The policies and procedures in 47.304-1 and -3 govern the transportation of supplies from sources in the Contiguous United States (CONUS), except when identifiable costs, nature of the supplies (security, safety, or value), delivery requirements (premium modes of transport, escorts, transit arrangements, and tentative conditions), or other advantages, limitations, or requirements dictate otherwise. The policies and procedures in 47.304-4 govern the transportation of supplies from sources outside CONUS.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Generally, solicit offers, and award contracts, with delivery terms on the basis prescribed in 47.304.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The delivery term must not dictate the place of performance of Government acquisition quality assurance actions or the place of <span class="ph" id="FAR_47_302___Hlk207202950">acceptance</span>, except that if acceptance is at destination, use f.o.b. destination (see 47.304-1(f)).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The fact that transportation is f.o.b. destination does not alone necessitate changing the place of acceptance from origin to destination. Further, the fact that acceptance is at origin does not necessitate an f.o.b. origin delivery term. Providing for inspection and acceptance at origin (if appropriate under 46.402), in conjunction with an f.o.b. destination term, might benefit both the Government and the contractor. Government acceptance of title at origin permits payment to the contractor, provided the invoice is supported either—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> By a copy of the signed commercial bill of lading (indicating the carrier’s receipt of the supplies covered by the invoice for transportation to the destination specified in the contract); or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> By other appropriate evidence of shipment to the destination for the contractor’s account.</p></div>
