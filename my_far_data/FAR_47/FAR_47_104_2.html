<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">F.o.b. destination</em>. 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 13712 rates do not apply to shipments under fixed-price f.o.b. destination contracts (delivered price).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">F.o.b. origin</em>. The contracting officer may occasionally require the contractor to prepay the freight charges to a specific destination. In such cases, the contractor must use a commercial bill of lading, and the contractor must invoice the direct and actual transportation cost as a separate item. The clause at 52.247-1, Commercial Bill of Lading Notations, ensures that the Government in this type of arrangement obtains the benefit of 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 13712 rates.</p></div>
