                <h2>47.208Report of shipment (REPSHIP).</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">Military and, as required, civilian agency, storage and distribution points, depots, and other receiving activities require advance notice of shipments en route from contractorsâ€™ plants. Generally, this notification is required only for classified material; sensitive, controlled, and certain other protected material; explosives, and some other hazardous materials; selected shipments requiring movement control; or minimum carload or truckload shipments. It facilitates arrangements for transportation control, labor, space, and use of materials handling equipment at destination. Also, timely receipt of notices by the consignee transportation office precludes the incurring of demurrage and vehicle detention charges.</p></div>
