The associated increase or decrease is based on the difference between the negotiated incentives, fees, and profits and the amounts that would have been negotiated had the cost impact been known at the time the contracts and subcontracts were negotiated; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Calculate the increased cost to the Government in the aggregate.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> For required or desirable changes, negotiate an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of the contract.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> Remedies.
