Agencies may contract without providing for full and open competition when the agency's need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured, financially or otherwise, unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Period of performance</em>. The total period of performance of a contract greater than the simplified acquisition threshold awarded or modified using this authority—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> May not exceed the time necessary—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> To meet the unusual and compelling requirements of the work to be performed under the contract; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> For the agency to enter into another contract for the required goods and services through competitive procedures; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> May not exceed one year, including all options, unless the head of the agency determines that exceptional circumstances apply. This determination—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Is separate from the justification and approval for the use of the unusual and compelling urgency authority and must be documented in the contract file;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Does not cover any subsequent modification that further extends the period of performance, except for options included in the original determination.

The justification and approval for the use of this authority, as well as the determination described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, may be made after contract award when making the determination before award would unreasonably delay the acquisition.</p></div>
