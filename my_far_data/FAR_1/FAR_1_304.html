<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_1_304__d36e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Class deviations affect more than one contract action. A deviation for any solicitation that will result in multiple contract awards will need to be done as a class deviation. When an agency knows that it will require a class deviation on a permanent basis, it may develop and propose a FAR revision.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_1_304__d36e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Agency heads may authorize class deviations from the FAR. Agency-specific class deviations must be approved by the FAR Council, except where required to implement agency-specific executive or statutory direction. Agencies requesting approval must send the proposed class deviation to the FAR Secretariat at   <a aria-label="GSARegSec@gsa.gov.

Urgent requests will be decided within 24 hours of receipt of the request. Agencies may proceed if they do not receive responses within these time frames.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Agencies must email a copy of each agency-approved class deviation to the FAR Secretariat at   <a aria-label="GSARegSec@gsa.gov.
