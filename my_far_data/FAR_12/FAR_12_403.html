Purchase orders (including orders against blanket purchase agreements) may be used to make micro-purchases.

Contracting officers may use it in limited circumstances and only when advantageous to the Government if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> An agency authorizes use of the SF 44.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The amount of the purchase is at or below the micro-purchase threshold or higher dollar thresholds established by an agency for purchases made under unusual and compelling urgency or in support of contingency operations.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The supplies or services are immediately available, and one delivery and one payment will be made.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Its use is determined to be more economical and efficient than use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_12_403__d732e46"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Imprest funds and third-party drafts may be used to acquire supplies or services if an agency receives authorization from the Department of Treasury to use these methods and the purchases are made in accordance with Part IV of the Treasury Financial Manual for Guidance of Departments and Agencies. An imprest fund transaction shall not exceed $500 or such other limits as have been approved by the agency head. A third-party draft transaction shall not exceed $2,500, unless authorized at a higher level in accordance with Treasury restrictions.</p></div>
