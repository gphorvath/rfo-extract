<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Requirement</em>. For acquisitions valued up to $9 million, issue a request for quotations (RFQ) followed by a purchase order.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Legal effect of quotations</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Neither a quotation nor the purchase order issued by the Government in response to a quotation form a binding contract. The purchase order is the Government’s offer to a supplier to buy certain products or services upon specified terms and conditions.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> A binding contract is formed when the supplier accepts the Government’s offer, either by written acceptance of the purchase order or substantial performance of the purchase order. The contracting officer may request that the contractor provide written acceptance of the order.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Method</em>. To promote competition to the maximum extent practicable—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Normally, post RFQs in the Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE). Use the Standard Form (SF) SF 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Products and Commercial Services; or SF 18, Request for Quotations; or similar agency form or automated format. For acquisitions greater than the SAT, combine the presolicitation notice and the RFQ according to 12.202(b).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For acquisitions at or below the SAT, the contracting officer may choose to solicit quotations directly from suppliers. When soliciting directly-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Post a presolicitation notice in the GPE according to subpart 5.1, unless an exception in 5.101(b) applies;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Solicit quotations from at least three sources; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Whenever practicable, solicit quotations from two sources not included in the previous solicitation.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Innovation</em>. In line with 1.102, Guiding principles for the System, agencies are encouraged to use additional innovative approaches to the maximum extent practicable when soliciting quotations and issuing purchase orders to—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Reduce administrative costs and lead time;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Improve opportunities for small business concerns;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Promote efficiency and economy in contracting; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Avoid unnecessary burdens for agencies and contractors.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Other flexibilities</em>. The following are examples of flexibilities that may be leveraged when using simplified procedures:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Standing price quotation</em>. Instead of soliciting new quotations for each purchase (see 12.201-1(c)(2)), a contracting officer may rely upon standing price quotations, as long as the contracting officer validates before award that the pricing is current and reasonable.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Unpriced purchase order</em>. An unpriced purchase order is an order for supplies or services, the price of which is not established at the time of issuance of the order.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> An unpriced purchase order may be used only when it is impractical to obtain pricing in advance of issuance of the purchase order. Examples of such situations include:</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Repairs to equipment requiring disassembly to determine the nature and extent of repairs;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Material available from only one source and for which cost cannot readily be established; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> Supplies or services for which prices are known to be competitive, but exact prices are not known (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, miscellaneous repair parts, maintenance agreements).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> When issuing an unpriced purchase order, include-</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> A realistic monetary limitation (either for each line item or for the total order) that is an obligation subject to adjustment once a firm price is established; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The following statement:</p><p class="ListL4">This is a firm order ONLY if your price does not exceed the maximum line item or total price in the Schedule. Submit invoices to the Contracting Officer. If you cannot perform in exact accordance with this order, Withhold Performance, and notify the Contracting Officer immediately, giving your quotation.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Follow up on each order to ensure timely pricing. Review the invoice price and, if the price is reasonable (see 12.204(a)), process the invoice for payment.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> <em class="ph i">Blanket purchase agreement</em>. A blanket purchase agreement (BPA) is a method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply. The Government is only obligated to the extent that authorized orders are placed under BPAs.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> BPAs may be established with-</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> More than one supplier for supplies or services of the same type to provide maximum practicable competition; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> A single firm from which numerous individual purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold will likely be made in a given period.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If, for a particular purchase greater than the micro-purchase threshold, there is an insufficient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the contracting officer shall-</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Solicit quotations from other sources and make the purchase as appropriate; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> If practical, establish additional BPAs to facilitate future purchases if recurring requirements for the same or similar supplies or services seem likely and qualified sources are willing to accept BPAs.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The existence of a BPA does not justify soliciting from only one source or avoiding small business set-asides. The requirements in 12.102 and 12.103 apply to each order under the BPA.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The BPA must include-</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> A statement that the supplier will furnish supplies or services, described in general terms, if and when requested by authorized individuals during a specified period and within a stipulated aggregate amount, if any.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> A statement that the Government is obligated only to the extent of authorized purchases actually made under the BPA.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> The dollar limitation for each individual purchase under the BPA, which may not exceed the threshold for use of simplified procedures at 12.201-1(a) (including the increased threshold at 12.001(c).</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(D)</span> A list of individuals authorized to place orders or make purchases under the BPA.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(E)</span> Information that must be included in delivery or shipment documentation.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(F)</span> Instructions for proper invoicing under the BPA (e.g., process for periodic billings).</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(G)</span> Any clauses that may be applicable to purchases under the BPA (see 12.205(b)).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Review BPAs at least annually to ensure that authorized procedures are being followed. Maintain awareness of changes in market conditions, sources of supply, and other pertinent factors that may warrant making new agreements with different suppliers or modifying existing agreements.</p></div>
