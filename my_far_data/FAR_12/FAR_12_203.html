<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_12_203__d710e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Factors. For most acquisitions of commercial products or commercial services, evaluation factors need not be more detailed than technical (capability of the products or services offered to meet the agency’s needs), price, and past performance.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Technical. Evaluate technical based on how well the proposed products or services meet the Government’s requirement. Predetermined subfactors are not required.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Past performance. Past performance should be an important evaluation factor for award. Consider past performance information from a wide variety of sources both inside and outside the Government. This may include reviewing performance information reported to the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System, as well as other sources of information. For some commercial products or services, such as emerging technology, this should include consideration of commercial market experience. Contracting officers may consider an offeror’s experience as a subcontractor.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Price. Evaluate prices inclusive of transportation charges from the shipping point of the supplier to the delivery destination. Obtain prompt payment discounts to the maximum extent practicable, but do not include such discounts when evaluating the prices of quotations or offers.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_12_203__d710e34"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Basis for award. In the solicitation, notify potential quoters or offerors of the basis on which the agency will make the award decision. See 12.205(a)(2) on use of the solicitation provision at 52.212-2 for this purpose.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Evaluation process. Ensure that quotations and offers can be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Timely quotations and offers. Consider all quotations or offers that are timely received. Exercise good business judgment in deciding whether or not to accept a quotation or offer received after the due date or time (see 52.212-1(c)).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Quotations. The contracting officer has broad discretion in establishing how quotations will be evaluated. For example, the contracting officer may perform a comparative evaluation of quotations. The evaluation procedures are not subject to part 15 or 14. Contracting officers are not required to have evaluation plans, score quotations, or establish a competitive range before communicating with quoters or soliciting revised quotations.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Offers. Follow the procedures in part 15 when evaluating proposals and the procedures in part 14 when opening bids. When using the procedures in part 15, do so in conjunction with the procedures in this section. Follow the procedures in part 36 when acquiring construction as a commercial service.</p></div>
