<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">For acquisitions valued at greater than $9 million, use the procedures in this subpart in conjunction with the procedures in part 15 for requests for proposals (RFPs) or part 14 for invitations for bids (IFBs), as appropriate. Use of an RFP is the preferred method because it includes consideration of past performance when evaluating offers (see 12.203(a)(2)).</p></div>
