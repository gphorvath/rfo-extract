                <h2>25.103Exceptions.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">When one of the following exceptions applies, the contracting officer may acquire a foreign end product without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute:</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Public interest.</em> The head of the agency may make a determination that domestic preference would be inconsistent with the public interest. This exception applies when an agency has an agreement with a foreign government that provides a blanket exception to the Buy American statute.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Nonavailability.</em> The Buy American statute does not apply with respect to articles, materials, or supplies if articles, materials, or supplies of the class or kind to be acquired, either as end items or components, are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Class nonavailability determinations.</em></p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> A nonavailability determination has been made for the articles listed in 25.104. This determination does not necessarily mean that there is no domestic source for the listed items, but that domestic sources can only meet 50 percent or less of total U.S. Government and nongovernment demand.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Before acquisition of an article on the list, the procuring agency is responsible to conduct market research appropriate to the circumstances, including seeking of domestic sources. This applies to acquisition of an article as—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> An end product; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> A significant component (valued at more than 50 percent of the value of all the components).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The determination in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply if the contracting officer learns at any time before the time designated for receipt of bids in sealed bidding or final offers in negotiation that an article on the list is available domestically in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality to meet the requirements of the solicitation. The contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Ensure that the appropriate Buy American statute provision and clause are included in the solicitation (see 25.601(a), 25.601(b), or 25.602);</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Specify in the solicitation that the article is available domestically and that offerors and contractors may not treat foreign components of the same class or kind as domestic components; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> Submit a copy of supporting documentation to your agency representative at the FAR Council, in accordance with agency procedures, for possible removal of the article from the list.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Individual nonavailability determinations.</em></p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The head of the contracting activity must first make a determination that an article, material, or supply is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality (i.e., individual nonavailability waiver determinations) in accordance with agency procedures. Prior to award, the agency must comply with the procedures in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. A determination is not required before January 1, 2030, if there is an offer for a foreign end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content (see 25.106(b)(2) and 25.106(c)(2)).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If the contracting officer considers that the nonavailability of an article is likely to affect future acquisitions, the contracting officer may submit a copy of the determination and supporting documentation to its agency representative at the FAR Council, in accordance with agency procedures, for possible addition to the list in 25.104.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Contracting officers must submit a proposed individual nonavailability waiver for review and posting to MadeinAmerica.gov using the digital waiver portal by the MIAO, unless an exception applies. The contracting officer must not make an award until the contracting officer has received confirmation that the MIAO has completed its review of the proposed nonavailability waiver determination; MIAO has waived the requirement for a review; or an exception to posting the proposed nonavailability waiver determination applies. Agencies will issue final waivers only after completing coordination with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Contracting officers must post a proposed individual nonavailability waiver determination to MadeinAmerica.gov by inputting the required information into a digital waiver. The digital waiver requires the standardized nonavailability waiver determination information listed in the OMB guidance, and additional information, such as the proposed duration of the nonavailability waiver determination and whether the waiver determination is for an indefinite-delivery type contract (i.e., a “multi-procurement waiver” in the digital form) or for a contract that is not an indefinite-delivery type contract (i.e., an “individual waiver” in the digital form).</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Unless waived, all proposed nonavailability waiver determination information posted using the digital waiver will be reviewed by MIAO. Certain information from the nonavailability waiver determination will be available to the public at MadeinAmerica.gov immediately upon posting the proposed waiver and prior to review by MIAO. The digital waiver identifies for the contracting officer those fields that will be made public and those fields that are not public because they are for government use only. Contracting officers must not enter source selection information (see 2.101 and 3.104) in any field. Contracting officers must not enter in the public fields any information that cannot be made public.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> MIAO plans to complete the majority of nonavailability waiver determination reviews within 15 business days from submission to OMB. Waivers involving certain small dollar transactions (e.g., over the micro-purchase threshold but less than $25,000), will generally be reviewed by MIAO rapidly but waivers for larger and more complex acquisitions, or waivers implicating critical supply chains, may take the full 15 business days. Contracting officers should consider the timeframes above for acquisition planning.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(D)</span> Contracting officers are not required to post proposed individual nonavailability waiver determinations to MadeinAmerica.gov prior to waiver determination issuance when−</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The acquisition is conducted under reduced competition due to urgency (see FAR 6.103-2 and 13.106-1(b)) or where the agency is obligated by law to act more quickly than the review procedures established in this section allow. In these instances, contracting officers must file an urgent requirement report for such waivers using information found in the digital waiver portal within 30 days of award. MIAO will make relevant information available to the public on MadeinAmerica.gov but will not make a determination on such waivers; or</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The acquisition is for products that have been determined to be nonavailable on a class basis and are listed in 25.104.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Unreasonable cost.</em> The contracting officer may determine that the cost of a domestic end product would be unreasonable, in accordance with 25.106 and subpart 25.5.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Resale.</em> The contracting officer may purchase foreign end products specifically for commissary resale.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Information technology that is a commercial product.</em> The restriction on purchasing foreign end products does not apply to the acquisition of information technology that is a commercial product, when using fiscal year 2004 or subsequent fiscal year funds (section 535(a) of Division F, Title V, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, and similar sections in subsequent appropriations acts).</p></div>
