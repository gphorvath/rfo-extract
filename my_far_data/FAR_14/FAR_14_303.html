<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> All bids (including modifications) received before the time set for the opening of bids must be secured in a locked bid box, a safe, or in a secure restricted-access electronic bid box (i.e., secure password protected file folder on a controlled access Government computer network).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The bid opening officer must inform those present at the public bid opening that the time set for the opening of bids has arrived.</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The bid opening officer must personally and publicly open all bids received before the exact time set for opening of bids and if practical, read the bids aloud to all present.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The public may not attend bid openings for classified acquisitions. No public record must be made of bids or bid prices received in response to classified invitations for bids.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> The contracting officer may postpone the public bid opening if the contracting officer determines in writing there is reason to believe—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> An important segment of bidders has been delayed in the mail;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> That there are delays in the communications system specified for transmission of bids;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> That circumstances beyond the control of the bidders have delayed their timely submission, (e.g., flood, fire, accident, weather, strikes, or Government equipment blackout or malfunction); or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> That emergency or unanticipated events has interrupted normal Governmental processes so that the scheduled opening of bids is impractical.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> Publicly post a determination to postpone a bid opening under paragraph (d) of this section.

In such cases, the time of actual bid opening must be deemed to be the time set for bid opening for the purpose of determining “late bids” under section 14.301. A note should be made on the abstract of bids or otherwise added to the file explaining the circumstances of the postponement.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> The bid opening officer must complete and certify the accuracy of the Standard Form 1409, Abstract of Offers, or Optional Form 1419, Abstract of Offers—Construction (or automated equivalent) as soon after bid opening as practicable. Where bid items are too numerous to warrant complete recording of all bids, abstract entries for individual bids may be limited to item numbers and bid prices. The contracting activity may use the extra columns and SF 1410, Abstract of Offers—Continuation, and OF 1419A, Abstract of Offers—Construction, Continuation Sheet, to label and record such information as necessary.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(h)</span> Abstracts of offers for unclassified acquisitions must be available for public inspection</p></div>
