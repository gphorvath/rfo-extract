The Government places orders for individual requirements. Quantity limits may be stated as number of units or as dollar values.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The contract must require the Government to order and the contractor to furnish at least a stated minimum quantity of supplies or services. To ensure that the contract is binding, the minimum quantity must be more than a nominal quantity, but it should not exceed the amount that the Government is fairly certain to order.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> In addition, if ordered, the contractor must furnish any additional quantities, not to exceed the stated maximum. The contracting officer should establish a reasonable maximum quantity based on market research, trends on recent contracts for similar supplies or services, survey of potential users, or any other rational basis.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> The contract may also specify maximum or minimum quantities that the Government may order under each task or delivery order and the maximum that it may order during a specific period of time.</p></div>
