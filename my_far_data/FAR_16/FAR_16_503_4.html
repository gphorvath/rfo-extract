<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Requirements contracts obligate the seller to supply all the buyer's actual needs, and the buyer to purchase all their requirements from that specific seller, within stated limits of the contract. The contract must state, if feasible, the maximum limit of the contractor’s obligation to deliver and the Government’s obligation to order. The contract may also set minimum and/or maximum limits on the quantities the Government may order under each individual order or over a specified period of time.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The solicitation and resulting contract must state a realistic estimated total quantity. This estimated total quantity is not a representation to an offeror or contractor that the estimate is guaranteed quantity, or that conditions affecting requirements will stay the same. The contracting officer should base the estimate on the most current information available, and may calculate the estimate based on records of previous requirements and consumption, or by other means.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> When a requirements contract is used to acquire work (e.g., repair, modification, or overhaul) on existing items of Government property, the contracting officer must specify in the Schedule that failure of the Government to furnish such items in the amounts or quantities described in the Schedule as "estimated" or "maximum" will not entitle the contractor to any equitable adjustment in price under the Government Property clause of the contract.</p></div>
