A brand-name item, even if available on more than one contract, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer. Brand-name specifications must not be used unless the particular brand-name, product, or feature is essential to the Government’s requirements and market research indicates other companies’ similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency’s needs.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Brand-name requirements must be justified and approved when the requirement is determined, using the format(s) and requirements from 16.507-6(d)-(e)), modified to show the brand-name justification, unless—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A justification covering the requirements in the order was previously approved for the contract in accordance with 6.302-1(c); or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The base contract is a single-award contract.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> For an order in excess of $40,000 ($30,000 prior to October 1, 2025), the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Post the justification and supporting documentation on the agency website used (if any) to solicit offers for orders under the contract; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Provide the justification and supporting documentation along with the solicitation to all contract awardees.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The justification for brand-name requirements may apply to the portion of the acquisition requiring the brand-name item.
