                <h2>16.304-3 Completion and term forms.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract may take one of two basic forms-completion or term.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The completion form describes the scope of work by stating a definite goal or target and specifying an end product. This form of contract normally requires the contractor to complete and deliver the specified end product (e.g., a final report of research accomplishing the goal or target) within the estimated cost, if possible, as a condition for payment of the entire fixed fee. However, if the work costs more than estimated, the Government may increase allowable costs to complete the work without increasing the fee.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The term form describes the scope of work in general terms and requires the contractor to work at a specified level for a specific time period. The term form may not be used unless required by the contract to provide a specific level of effort within a definite time period. Under this form, if the performance is considered satisfactory by the Government, the fixed fee is payable at the end of the agreed upon period. Renewal for further periods of performance is a new acquisition that involves new cost and fee arrangements.</p></div>
