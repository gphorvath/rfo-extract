<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">Each agency must collect relevant data on award fee and incentive fees paid to contractors and include performance measures to evaluate such data on a regular basis to determine effectiveness of award and incentive fees as a tool for improving contractor performance and achieving desired program outcomes. This information should be considered as part of the acquisition planning process (see part 7) in determining the appropriate type of contract to be used for future acquisitions.</p></div>
