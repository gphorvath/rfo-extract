<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Procedures.</em> Orders placed and BPAs established against multiple-award contracts are exempt from the competition requirements in part 6. However, the contracting officer must justify placing an order valued above the micro-purchase threshold (MPT) on a sole source basis in accordance with this subsection.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Exceptions</em>. The exceptions permitting an order or a BPA valued above the MPT to be placed on a sole source basis are:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The agency need for the supplies or services is so urgent that providing a fair opportunity would result in unacceptable delays.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> For orders exceeding the SAT, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the purchase be made from a specified source.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, the order satisfies one of the exceptions permitting the use of other than full and open competition listed in part 6.103 (10 U.S.C. 3406(c)(5)). The public interest exception must not be used unless Congress is notified in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(7).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Small business considerations.</em> Part 19 and Public Law 111-240 (15 U.S.C. 644(r)) provide authority for setting aside orders and placing orders under reserves, which are not subject to the justification, approval, and posting requirements in paragraphs (d)-(f).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Justification</em>. The justification for an exception to fair opportunity must be in writing as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)-(3).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Orders valued above the micro-purchase threshold but not above the SAT</em>. The contracting officer must document the basis for using an exception to the fair opportunity process. If the contracting officer uses the logical follow-on exception, the rationale must describe why the relationship between the initial order and the follow-on is logical (e.g., in terms of scope, period of performance, or value).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Orders valued above the SAT</em>. As a minimum, each justification must include the following information:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity."</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Identification of the exception to fair opportunity (see paragraph (b)) and the supporting rationale, including a demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the exception cited. If the contracting officer uses the logical follow-on exception, the rationale must describe why the relationship between the initial order and the follow-on is logical (e.g., in terms of scope, period of performance, or value).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vi)</span> Any other facts supporting the justification.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vii)</span> A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the exception to fair opportunity before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(viii)</span> The contracting officer’s certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer’s knowledge and belief.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ix)</span> Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government’s minimum needs or requirements or other rationale for an exception to fair opportunity) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(x)</span> A written determination by the approving official that one of the circumstances in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) applies to the order.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Approval</em>.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> For proposed orders valued above the SAT, but not valued above $900,000 ($750,000 prior to October 1, 2025), the ordering activity contracting officer’s certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the ordering activity contracting officer’s knowledge and belief will serve as approval, unless a higher approval level is established in accordance with agency procedures.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For a proposed order valued above $900,000 ($750,000 prior to October 1, 2025), but not above $20 million ($15 million prior to October 1, 2025), the justification must be approved by the advocate for competition of the activity placing the order, or by an official named in paragraph (e)(3) or (4). This authority is not delegable.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> For a proposed order valued above $20 million ($15 million prior to October 1, 2025), but not above $90 million ($75 million prior to October 1, 2025) (or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, not above $150 million ($100 million prior to October 1, 2025), the justification must be approved by—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The head of the procuring activity placing the order;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> A designee who—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> If a member of the armed forces, is a general or flag officer;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> If a civilian, is serving in a position in a grade above GS-15 under the General Schedule (or in a comparable or higher position under another schedule); or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> An official named in paragraph (e)(4) of this subsection.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> For a proposed order valued above $90 million ($75 million prior to October 1, 2025) (or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, above $150 million ($100 million prior to October 1, 2025)), the justification must be approved by the senior procurement executive of the agency placing the order. This authority is not delegable, except in the case of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, acting as the senior procurement executive for the Department of Defense.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> <em class="ph i">Posting</em>.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4), within 14 days after placing an order or establishing a BPA valued above the SAT on a sole source basis according to paragraph (b), the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Publish a notice to the GPE; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Post the justification required by paragraph (d)(2) for a minimum of 30 days)-</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> At the GPE <u class="ph u"><a href="https://www.sam.gov">https://www.sam.gov</a></u> ; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> On the Web site of the agency, which may provide access to the justifications by linking to the GPE.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> In the case of an order permitted under paragraph (b)(1), the justification must be posted within 30 days after award of the order.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Contracting officers must carefully screen all justifications for contractor proprietary data and remove all such data, and such references and citations as are necessary to protect the proprietary data, before posting the justification. Contracting officers must also be guided by the exemptions to disclosure of information contained in the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the prohibitions against disclosure in part 24 in determining whether other data should be removed. Although the submitter notice process set out in Executive Order 12600 "Predisclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information" does not apply, if the justification appears to contain proprietary data, the contracting officer should provide the contractor that submitted the information an opportunity to review the justification for proprietary data before posting the justification, redacted as necessary. This process must not prevent or delay posting the justification in accordance with the timeframes required in paragraphs (f)(1)-(2).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The posting requirement does not apply when disclosure would compromise the national security (e.g., would result in disclosure of classified information) or create other security risks.</p></div>
