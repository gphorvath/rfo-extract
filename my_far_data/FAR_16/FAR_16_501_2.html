<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> There are three types of indefinite-delivery contracts: definite-quantity contracts, requirements contracts, and indefinite-quantity contracts. The appropriate type of indefinite-delivery contract may be used to acquire supplies and/or services when the exact times and/or exact quantities of future deliveries are not known at the time of contract award. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 3401 and 41 U.S.C. 4101, requirements contracts and indefinite-quantity contracts are also known as delivery-order contracts or task-order contracts.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Indefinite-delivery contracts may provide for any appropriate cost or pricing arrangement under part 16. Cost or pricing arrangements that provide for an estimated quantity of supplies or services (e.g., estimated number of labor hours) must comply with the appropriate procedures of this subpart.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3206(c), for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contracting officer may choose not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for award when a solicitation—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Has an estimated value above the simplified acquisition threshold;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Will result in multiple-award contracts that are for the same or similar services; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> States that the Government intends to make an award to each and all qualifying offerors.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If the contracting officer chooses not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for the contract award, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i), the contracting officer shall consider price or cost as one of the factors in the selection decision for each order placed under the contract.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The exception in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this subsection shall not apply to solicitations for multiple-award contracts that provide for sole source orders pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Task order and delivery order contracts (requirements contracts and indefinite-quantity contracts) have an ordering period in which orders may be placed. Individual task and delivery orders have a period of performance effective for that specific task or delivery order’s scope of work. The effective period of a task or delivery order contract includes the ordering period of the base contract and any period of performance of task orders beyond the end of the ordering period.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Limitation on ordering period</em>. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3403, for the DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, the head of an agency entering into a task or delivery order contract may provide for the contract to cover any period up to five years and may extend the contract period for one or more successive periods pursuant to an option provided in the contract or a modification of the contract. The total contract period as extended may not exceed 10 years unless such head of an agency determines in writing that exceptional circumstances necessitate a longer contract period.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Limitation on ordering period for task-order contracts for advisory and assistance services.</em></p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3405, except as provided for in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection, the ordering period of a task-order contract for advisory and assistance services, including all periods of extensions of the contract under options, modifications or otherwise, may not exceed 5 years.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The 5-year limitation does not apply when—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> A longer ordering period is specifically authorized by statute; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The contract is for an acquisition of supplies or services that includes the acquisition of advisory and assistance services and the contracting officer, or other official designated by the head of the agency, determines that the advisory and assistance services are incidental and not a significant component of the contract.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The contracting officer may extend the contract on a sole-source basis for a period not exceeding 6 months if the contracting officer, or other official designated by the head of the agency, determines that—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> The award of a follow-on contract is delayed by circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the initial contract was entered into; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The extension is necessary to ensure continuity of services, pending the award of, and commencement of performance under, the follow-on contract.</p></div>
