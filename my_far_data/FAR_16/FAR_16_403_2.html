                <h2>16.403-2 Performance incentives.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Performance incentives may be considered in connection with specific product characteristics (e.g., a missile range, an aircraft speed, an engine thrust, or a vehicle maneuverability) or other specific areas of the contractor’s performance. Incentives should be linked to the contractor’s profit or fee based on how their actual performance compares to the set targets.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> To the maximum extent practicable, positive and negative performance incentives for objectively measured tasks should be considered when the quality of performance is critical, and incentives are likely to motivate the contractor.</p></div>
