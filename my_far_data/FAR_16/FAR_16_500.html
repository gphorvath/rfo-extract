<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for making awards of indefinite-delivery contracts and subsequent orders and establishes a preference for making multiple awards of indefinite-quantity contracts.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> This subpart does not limit the use of other than competitive procedures authorized by part 6.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> See part 19 for procedures to set aside part or parts of multiple-award contracts for small businesses and to reserve one or more awards for small business on multiple-award contracts.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> The statutory multiple award preference (see 10 U.S.C. 3403 and 41 U.S.C. 4103) implemented by this subpart does not apply to architect-engineer contracts subject to the procedures in part 36. However, agencies are not precluded from making multiple awards for architect-engineer services using the procedures in this subpart, provided the selection of contractors and placement of orders are consistent with part 36.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> This subpart does not limit the authority of the General Services Administration (GSA) to enter into schedule, multiple-award, or task or delivery order contracts under any other provision of law. Therefore, GSA regulations and the coverage for the Federal Supply Schedule program take precedence over this subpart.</p></div>
