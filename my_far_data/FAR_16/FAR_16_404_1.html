<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Description</em>. A fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract specifies a target cost, a target profit, a price ceiling (but not a profit ceiling or floor), and a formula for profit adjustments. When the final cost is less than the target cost, application of the formula results in a final profit greater than the target profit; conversely, when final cost is more than target cost, application of the formula results in a final profit less than the target profit, or even a net loss. If the final negotiated cost exceeds the price ceiling, the contractor absorbs the difference as a loss.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Limitations</em>. This contract type may be used only when-</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contractorâ€™s accounting system is adequate for providing data to support negotiation of final cost and incentive price revision; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Adequate cost or pricing information for establishing reasonable firm targets is available at the time of initial contract negotiation.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Contract schedule</em>. The contracting officer must specify in the contract schedule the target cost, target profit, and target price for each item subject to incentive price revision.</p></div>
