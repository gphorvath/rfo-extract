<div class="body"><p class="p">A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractorâ€™s experience in performing the contract. The contracting officer may use a firm-fixed-price contract in conjunction with an award-fee incentive (see 16.402) and performance or delivery incentives (see 16.403 and 16.404) when the award fee or incentive is based solely on factors other than cost. The contract type remains firm-fixed-price when used with these incentives.</p></div>
