<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">A basic ordering agreement is used to expedite contracting for supplies or services when specific items, quantities, and prices are uncertain at the time the agreement is executed, but a substantial number of requirements for the type of supplies or services covered by the agreement are anticipated to be purchased from the contractor. These procedures, when applied appropriately, can result in benefits and cost savings by reducing administrative lead-time, inventory investment, and inventory obsolescence due to design changes.</p></div>
