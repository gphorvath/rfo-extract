                <h2>16.507-2 Fair opportunity procedures.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Fair opportunity</em>.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer must provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each order or BPA valued above the micro-purchase threshold according to paragraph (c) and 16.507-3 through 16.507-5, unless a sole source order or BPA is justified and approved according to 16.507-6.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The contracting officer has broad discretion to develop appropriate order placement procedures. To maximize efficiency, ordering activities are encouraged to use innovative approaches when placing orders and establishing BPAs commensurate with the risk and complexity of the requirement. To solicit orders against indefinite-quantity contracts, issue a task order solicitation (e.g., request for quotation, request for proposal, or request for task plan). Learn more about innovative approaches in the Periodic Table of Acquisition Innovations at <a href="https://acquisitiongateway.gov/periodic-table">https://acquisitiongateway.gov/periodic-table</a>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The contracting officer should keep submission requirements to a minimum. The ordering process is not subject to the competition requirements in part 6 or the policies in subpart 15.3 or part 14. The contracting officer may use streamlined procedures, including oral presentations. The contracting officer is not required to have evaluation plans, score offeror responses, or establish a competitive range before communicating with interested parties or soliciting revised responses to the solicitation.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Task-order and delivery-order ombudsman</em>. The head of the agency must designate a task-order and delivery-order ombudsman. The ombudsman must review complaints from contractors and ensure they are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract. The ombudsman must be a senior agency official who is independent of the contracting officer and may be the agency’s advocate for competition.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Procedures</em>.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Requirements</em>. The contracting officer must-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Not use any method (such as allocation or designation of any preferred awardee) that would not result in fair consideration being given to all awardees prior to placing each order;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Tailor the procedures to the risk and complexity of each acquisition;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Include the procedures in the solicitation and the contract;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Consider price or cost under each order as one of the factors in the selection decision;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Except for DoD, document in the contract file a justification for use of the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process, including an explanation that the criteria at 15.101-2(c)(1)-(5) are met, when using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vi)</span> Except for DoD, avoid using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to acquire certain supplies and services in accordance with 15.101-2(d).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Considerations</em>. The contracting officer should consider the following when developing the placement procedures:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Past performance on earlier orders under the contract, including quality, timeliness and cost control. When past performance under the multiple-award contract is available and sufficient, it is unnecessary to consider past performance under other efforts.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Minimum order requirements.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The amount of time contractors need to make informed business decisions on whether to respond to potential orders.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Whether contractors could be encouraged to respond to potential orders by outreach efforts to promote exchanges of information, such as—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Seeking comments from two or more contractors on draft statements of work;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Using a multiphase approach when effort required to respond to a potential order may be resource intensive (e.g., requirements are complex or need continued development), where all contractors are initially considered on price considerations (e.g., rough estimates), and other considerations as appropriate (e.g., proposed conceptual approach, past performance). The contractors most likely to submit the highest value solutions are then selected for one-on-one sessions with the Government to increase their understanding of the requirements, provide suggestions for refining requirements, and discuss risk reduction measures.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> <em class="ph i">Blanket purchase agreements.</em> If authorized in the multiple-award contract according to 16.504(f)(8), the contracting officer may establish one or more blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) to fill repetitive needs for supplies or services (see 12.201-1(e)(3) and part 13). Establish BPAs using the fair opportunity procedures at 16.507-3 through 16.507-5, based on the total estimated value of the BPA. BPAs must include—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Sufficient detail about the need, such as scope of work or objectives;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> An ordering period, inclusive of any options or award terms;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Ordering activity requirements (e.g., invoicing, delivery, and discounts/other concessions) that are not otherwise included in the master multiple-award contract;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Ordering procedures that—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Identify the customers/individuals authorized to place orders and any limitations surrounding the placement of orders;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Ensure that for each order BPA recipients are provided the fair opportunity procedures in 16.507-3 through 16.507-5, based on the total estimated value of the order.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> If the ordering period of the BPA exceeds five years, on-ramps according to 16.504-4, unless the contracting officer documents that on-ramps are not in the best interest of the Government.</p></div>
