Price adjustments based on established prices should normally be restricted to industry-wide contingencies. Price adjustments based on labor and material costs should be limited to contingencies beyond the contractorâ€™s control. For use of economic price adjustment in sealed bid contracts, see part 14.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> When establishing the base level from which adjustments will be made, the contracting officer must ensure that contingency allowances are not duplicated by inclusion in both the base price and the adjustment requested by the contractor under economic price adjustment clause.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> In contracts that do not require submission of certified cost or pricing data, the contracting officer must obtain adequate data to establish the base level from which adjustment will be made and may require verification of data submitted.</p></div>
