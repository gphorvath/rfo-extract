<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">A fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is appropriate when it is established at the outset that a fair and reasonable firm-fixed-price cannot be negotiated, and that the amount involved and short performance period make the use of any other fixed-price contract type impracticable.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> A ceiling price must be negotiated for the contract at a level that reflects a reasonable sharing of risk by the contractor. The established ceiling price may be adjusted only if required by the operation of contract clauses providing for equitable adjustment or other revision of the contract price under stated circumstances.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The contract should be awarded only after negotiation of a billing price that is as fair and reasonable as the circumstances permit.</p></div>
