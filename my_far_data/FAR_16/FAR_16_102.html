<div class="body conbody"><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Selecting the contract type is generally a matter for negotiation and requires the exercise of sound judgment. When selecting and negotiating the contract type, the contracting officer must consider contract terms, risks (e.g., technical, performance, delivery), and pricing.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Contracting officers may instruct offerors in the solicitation to propose an alternative contract type within their proposals.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> A firm-fixed-price contract, which best uses the basic profit motive of business enterprise, must be used when the risk involved is minimal or can be predicted with an acceptable degree of certainty. However, when a reasonable basis for firm pricing does not exist, other contract types should be considered, and negotiations should be directed toward selecting a contract type (or combination of types) that will appropriately tie profit to contractor performance.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> In the course of an acquisition program, a series of contracts, or a single long-term contract, changing circumstances may necessitate different contract types than those used initially. Contracting officers should avoid extended use of a cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials contract after experience provides a basis for firmer pricing.</p></div>
