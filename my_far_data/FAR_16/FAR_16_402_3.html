<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">Award-fee provisions may be used in fixed-price contracts when the Government wishes to motivate a contractor and other incentives cannot be used because contractor performance cannot be measured objectively. Such contracts must establish a fixed-price (including normal profit) for the work, which will be paid for satisfactory contract performance. Any award fee earned will be paid in addition to that fixed-price. See 16.402-1 and 16.402-2 for the requirements on using this contract type.</p></div>
