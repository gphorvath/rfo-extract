                <h2>16.403-4 Structuring multiple-incentive contracts.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">A properly structured multiple-incentive arrangement should-</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Motivate the contractor to work towards outstanding results in all incentive areas; and</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Encourage trade-offs between incentive areas to align with the Governmentâ€™s goals. Due to the connection of cost, technical performance, and delivery goals, a contract that focuses on only one of the goals may jeopardize control over the others. All multiple-incentive contracts must include a cost incentive (or constraint) that prevents rewarding a contractor for greater technical performance or delivery results when the cost of those results outweighs their value to the Government.</p></div>
