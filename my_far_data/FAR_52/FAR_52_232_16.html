The Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the Default clause.</p><p class="ListL1">(i) <em class="ph i">Reservations of rights.</em></p><p class="ListL2">(1) No payment or vesting of title under this clause shall (i) excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under this contract or (ii) constitute a waiver of any of the rights or remedies of the parties under the contract.</p><p>(m) <em class="ph i">Progress payments under indefinite—delivery contracts.</em> The Contractor shall account for and submit progress payment requests under individual orders as if the order constituted a separate contract, unless otherwise specified in this contract.</p><p class="ListL2">(2) The Government's rights and remedies under this clause (i) shall not be exclusive but rather shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or this contract and (ii) shall not be affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise preclude or impair any further exercise under this clause or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the Government.</p><p class="ListL1">(j) <em class="ph i">Financing payments to subcontractors.</em> The financing payments to subcontractors mentioned in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this clause shall be all financing payments to subcontractors or divisions, if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="ListL2">(1) The amounts included are limited to—</p><p class="ListL3">(i) The unliquidated remainder of financing payments made;

or, if the subcontractor is a small business concern, 4 months.</p><p class="ListL2">(3) If the financing payments are in the form of progress payments, the terms of the subcontract or interdivisional order concerning progress payments—</p><p class="ListL3">(i) Are substantially similar to the terms of this clause for any subcontractor that is a large business concern, or this clause with its <em class="ph i">Alternate I</em> for any subcontractor that is a small business concern;</p><p class="ListL3">(ii) Are at least as favorable to the Government as the terms of this clause;</p><p class="ListL3">(iii) Are not more favorable to the subcontractor or division than the terms of this clause are to the Contractor;</p><p class="ListL3">(iv) Are in conformance with the requirements of FAR 32.504(e);

The Contractor shall not consider the need for such financing payments as a handicap or adverse factor in the award of subcontracts.</p><p class="ListL1">(k) <em class="ph i">Limitations on undefinitized contract actions.</em> Notwithstanding any other progress payment provisions in this contract, progress payments may not exceed 80 percent of costs incurred on work accomplished under undefinitized contract actions. A <em class="ph i">contract action</em> is any action resulting in a contract, as defined in subpart 2.1, including contract modifications for additional supplies or services, but not including contract modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to the Changes clause, or funding and other administrative changes. This limitation shall apply to the costs incurred, as computed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, and shall remain in effect until the contract action is definitized. Costs incurred which are subject to this limitation shall be segregated on Contractor progress payment requests and invoices from those costs eligible for higher progress payment rates. For purposes of progress payment liquidation, as described in paragraph (b) of this clause, progress payments for undefinitized contract actions shall be liquidated at 80 percent of the amount invoiced for work performed under the undefinitized contract action as long as the contract action remains undefinitized. The amount of unliquidated progress payments for undefinitized contract actions shall not exceed 80 percent of the maximum liability of the Government under the undefinitized contract action or such lower limit specified elsewhere in the contract. Separate limits may be specified for separate actions.</p><p class="ListL1">(l) <em class="ph i">Due date.</em> The designated payment office will make progress payments on the ____ [<em class="ph i">Contracting Officer insert date as prescribed by agency head; if not prescribed, insert “30th”</em>] day after the designated billing office receives a proper progress payment request. In the event that the Government requires an audit or other review of a specific progress payment request to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the specified due date. Progress payments are considered contract financing and are not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.</p><p class="ListL1">(m) Progress payments under indefinite—delivery contracts.
