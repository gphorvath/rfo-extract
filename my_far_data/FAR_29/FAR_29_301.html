<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_29_301__d1875e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Generally, purchases and leases made by the Federal Government are immune from State and local taxation. However, whether a specific purchase or lease is immune is a legal question requiring advice from the agency's legal counsel.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_29_301__d1875e15"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> When economically feasible, executive agencies must take full advantage of all exemptions from State and local taxation. When appropriate, the contracting officer must provide a Standard Form 1094, U.S. Tax Exemption Form (see part 53), or other evidence listed in 29.304(a) to establish that the Government is making the purchase.</p></div>
