                <h2>29.303North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Act.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">The imposition of State and local taxes may result in special contract considerations including the following:</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_29_303__d1877e12"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Act allows counties and incorporated cities and towns to receive an annual refund from the Secretary of Revenue for sales and use taxes indirectly paid on building materials, supplies, fixtures, and equipment that become part of or are attached to any building or structure built, altered, or repaired for these counties and incorporated cities and towns in North Carolina. In United States v. Clayton, 250 F. Supp. 827 (1965), the court ruled that the United States is entitled to the refund but must follow the Act's refund procedure and regulations to recover what it is due.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_29_303__d1877e17"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> To receive the refund, the Act requires claimants to file a written request within 6 months after the end of their fiscal year, supported by records, receipts, and information that the Secretary of Revenue requires. Claimants will not receive a refund for applications filed late or not meeting the Secretary of Revenue's requirements. These requirements appear in regulations stating that to support a refund claim for sales or use taxes paid on purchases of building materials, supplies, fixtures, or equipment by a contractor, the Government must get certified statements from the contractor showing the cost of property purchased from each vendor and the amount of sales or use taxes paid. If a contractor makes several purchases from the same vendor, the certified statement must show the invoice numbers, invoice dates, total invoice amount, and sales and use taxes paid. The statement must also include the cost of any tangible personal property the contractor took from warehouse stock and the amount of sales or use tax paid. The general contractor must obtain and provide to the claimant similar certified statements from subcontractors. The contractor's statement must show any local sales or use taxes separately from State sales or use taxes.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_29_303__d1877e22"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The clause prescribed at 29.401-2 requires contractors to submit certified statements disclosing North Carolina State and local sales and use taxes paid during the 12-month period ending the previous September 30 to contracting officers by November 30 each year. The contracting officer must ensure contractors comply with this requirement and obtain the annual refund to which the Government is entitled. The refund application must be filed annually before March 31 in the manner and form the Secretary of Revenue requires.
