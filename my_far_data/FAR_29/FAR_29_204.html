<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_29_204__d1871e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Title 26 U.S.C. 5000C and its implementing regulations at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7 require acquiring agencies to collect this excise tax (section 5000C tax) through withholding on applicable contract payments (see 29.402-3, 31.205-41(b)(8)). Agencies merely withhold the tax for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). All substantive issues regarding the underlying section 5000C tax, such as the imposition of or exemption from the tax, are matters under IRS jurisdiction. For questions about interpreting IRS regulations, refer to   <a aria-label="https://www.irs.gov/help/tax-law-questions.

If a completed IRS Form W-14 is not submitted with a payment request, the default withholding percentage is 2 percent for that payment request. Information about IRS Form W-14 is available at   <a aria-label="www.irs.gov/w14.
