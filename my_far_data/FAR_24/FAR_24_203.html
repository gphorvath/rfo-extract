<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_24_203__d1605e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The Freedom of Information Act specifies how agencies must make their records available upon public request, sets strict time standards for agency responses, and exempts certain records from public disclosure. Each agency's implementation of these requirements appears in its respective title of the Code of Federal Regulations and is referenced in subpart 24.2 of its implementing acquisition regulations.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_24_203__d1605e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Contracting officers may receive requests for records that may be exempt from mandatory public disclosure. The most common exemptions are for trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)). Other exemptions include certain interagency or intra-agency memoranda, classified information, internal personnel rules, personal and medical information about individuals, and law enforcement.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Since these requests often involve complex issues requiring in-depth knowledge of court rulings and policy guidance, contracting officers must comply with their agency's implementing regulations. Contracting officers should obtain necessary guidance from agency officials responsible for Freedom of Information Act compliance. For additional assistance, authorized agency officials may contact the Department of Justice, Office of Information and Privacy. A Freedom of Information Act guide and other resources are available at the Department of Justice website under FOIA reference materials: <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip">http://www.usdoj.gov/oip</a>.</p></div>
