At a minimum, the notice must—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Identify the procurement;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Describe the nature of the agency official's participation in the procurement and specify the approximate dates or time period of participation; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Identify the offeror and describe its interest in the procurement.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Resumption of participation in a procurement</em>.</p><p>The official must remain disqualified until the agency, at its sole and exclusive discretion, authorizes the official to resume participation in the procurement according to 3.104-3(c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> After the conditions of 3.104-3(c)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) have been met, the head of the contracting activity (HCA), after consultation with the agency ethics official, may authorize the disqualified official to resume participation in the procurement, or may determine that an additional disqualification period is necessary to protect the procurement process integrity. When determining the disqualification period, the HCA must consider any factors that create an appearance that the disqualified official acted without complete impartiality. The HCA should document the reinstatement decision in writing.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Government officers or employees must also comply with 18 U.S.C. 208 and 5 CFR part 2635 regarding resumed participation in procurement matters.
