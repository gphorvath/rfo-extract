<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>Agencies are required by 41 U.S.C. 3707 and 10 U.S.C. 3307 to report to the Attorney General any bids or proposals that evidence a violation of the antitrust laws. These reports are in addition to those required by part 9.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>The antitrust laws are intended to ensure that markets operate competitively. Any agreement or mutual understanding among competing firms that restrains the natural operation of market forces is suspect. Paragraph (c) of this section identifies behavior patterns that are often associated with antitrust violations. Activities meeting the descriptions in paragraph (c) are not necessarily improper, but they are sufficiently questionable to warrant notifying the appropriate authorities, in accordance with agency procedures.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>Practices or events that may show violations of antitrust laws include-</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>The existence of an <em class="ph i">industry price list</em> or <em class="ph i">price agreement</em> to which contractors refer in formulating their offers;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>A sudden change from competitive bidding to identical bidding;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>Simultaneous price increases or follow-the-leader pricing;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span>Rotation of bids or proposals where each competitor takes turns being the low bidder, or where certain competitors bid low only on some sizes of contracts and high on other sizes;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span>Division of the market, so that certain competitors bid low only for contracts awarded by certain agencies, or for contracts in certain geographical areas, or on certain products, and bid high on all other jobs;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span>Establishment by competitors of a collusive price estimating system;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span>The filing of a joint bid by two or more competitors when at least one of the competitors has sufficient technical capability and productive capacity for contract performance;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(8)</span>Any incidents suggesting direct collusion among competitors, such as the appearance of identical calculation or spelling errors in two or more competitive offers or the submission by one firm of offers for other firms; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(9)</span>Statements by current employees, former employees, or competitors that an agreement to restrain trade exists.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>Contracting officers must report identical bids when the agency has reason to believe the bids resulted from collusion.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>For offers from foreign contractors on contracts to be performed outside the United States and its outlying areas, contracting officers may refer suspected collusive offers to the relevant foreign government authorities for appropriate action.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span>Agency reports must be addressed to the Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, Attention: Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, and must includeâ€”</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>A brief statement describing the suspected practice and the reason for the suspicion; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>The name, address, and telephone number of an individual in the agency who can be contacted for further information.</p></div>
