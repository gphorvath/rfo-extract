                <h2>3.705 Procedures.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Reporting</em>. The facts concerning any final conviction for any violation of 18 U.S.C. 201-224 involving or relating to agency contracts must be reported promptly to the agency head or designee for consideration. The agency head or designee must promptly notify the Civil Division, Department of Justice, that an action is being considered under this subpart.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Decision</em>. Following an assessment of the facts, the agency head or designee may declare void and rescind contracts with respect to which a final conviction has been entered, and recover the amounts expended and the property transferred by the agency under the terms of the contracts involved.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Decision-making process</em>. Agency procedures governing the voiding and rescinding decision-making process must be as informal as is practicable, consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness. At a minimum, agencies must provide the following:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>A notice of the proposed action to declare void and rescind the contract must be made in writing.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>A thirty calendar day period after receipt of the notice, for the contractor to submit pertinent information before any final decision is made.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>Upon request made within the period for submission of pertinent information, an opportunity must be afforded for a hearing at which witnesses may be presented, and any witness the agency presents may be confronted. However, no inquiry may be made regarding the validity of a conviction.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span>If the agency head or designee decides to declare void and rescind the contracts involved, that official must issue a written decision which—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span>States that determination;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span>Reflects consideration of the fair value of any tangible benefits received and retained by the agency; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span>States the amount due, and the property to be returned, to the agency.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>Notice of proposed action. The notice of the proposed action, at a minimum must—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>Advise that consideration is being given to declaring void and rescinding contracts awarded by the agency, and recovering the amounts expended and property transferred therefor, under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 218;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>Specifically identify the contracts affected by the action;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>Specifically identify the offense or final conviction on which the action is based;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span>State the amounts expended and property transferred under each of the contracts involved, and the money and the property demanded to be returned;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span>Identify any tangible benefits received and retained by the agency under the contract, and the value of those benefits, as calculated by the agency;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span>Advise that pertinent information may be submitted within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice, and that, if requested within that time, a hearing must be held at which witnesses may be presented and any witness the agency presents may be confronted; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span>Advise that action must be taken only after the agency head or designee issues a final written decision on the proposed action.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Final agency decision</em>. The agency head or designee must base the final decision on all available information, and any relevant information submitted in writing or presented during a hearing. If the agency decision declares void and rescinds the contract, the final decision must specify the amounts due and property to be returned to the agency and reflect consideration of the fair value of any tangible benefits received and retained by the agency. Notice of the decision must be sent promptly by certified mail, return receipt requested. When contracts are rescinded under the Act’s authority and the agency head demands recovery of amounts expended and property transferred, this is not considered a claim under 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes or part 33. Therefore, the procedures required by the statute and the FAR for the issuance of a final contracting officer decision are not applicable to final agency decisions under this subpart and must not be followed.</p></div>
