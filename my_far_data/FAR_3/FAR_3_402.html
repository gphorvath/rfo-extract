                <h2>3.402Statutory requirements.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">Contractors' arrangements to pay contingent fees for soliciting or obtaining Government contracts have long been considered contrary to public policy because such arrangements may lead to attempted or actual improper influence. In 10 U.S.C. 3321(b) and 41 U.S.C. 3901, Congress affirmed this public policy but permitted certain exceptions. These statutesâ€”</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>Require every negotiated contract to include a warranty by the contractor against contingent fees;</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>Permit, as an exception to the warranty, contingent fee arrangements between contractors and bona fide employees or bona fide agencies; and</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>Provide that if a contractor breaches or violates this warranty, the Government may annul the contract without liability or deduct from the contract price or consideration, or otherwise recover, the full amount of the contingent fee.</p></div>
