These persons may include consultants and trade associations.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span>In this section, "professional and technical services" means advice and analysis directly applying professional or technical expertise. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional or a technical person are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another, are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span>Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal action includes those in laws, regulations, and the actual award documents.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>Only the communications and services specifically authorized in paragraph (a) are permitted.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>The disclosure requirements in paragraph 3.802(b) do not apply to reasonable compensation paid to regularly employed officers of a person.</p></div>
