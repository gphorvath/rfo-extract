                <h2>42.202 Assignment of contract administration.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Delegating functions.</em> Contracting officers may delegate contract administration or specialized support services through interagency agreements or by direct request to the cognizant CAO listed in the Contract Administration Services Directory (CASD). The delegation should include-</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The name and address of the CAO designated to perform the administration (this information must also be entered in the contract);</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Any specials instructions, including any functions withheld or any specific authorization to perform functions listed in 42.302 (b);</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> A copy of the contract to be administered; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Copies of all contracting agency regulations or directives that are-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Incorporated into the contract by reference; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Otherwise, necessary to administer the contract, unless copies have been provided previously.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Special instructions.</em> As necessary, the contracting officer must advise the contractor (and other activities as appropriate) of any functions withheld from or additional functions delegated to the CAO.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Delegating additional functions</em>. For individual contracts or groups of contracts, the contracting officer may delegate additional functions beyond those listed in 42.302 to the CAO, provided that-</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Prior coordination with the CAO ensures the availability of required resources;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> In the case of authority to issue orders under provisioning procedures in existing contracts and under basic ordering agreements for items and services identified in the schedule, the head of the contracting activity or designee approves the delegation; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The delegation does not require the CAO to undertake new or follow-on acquisitions.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Rescinding functions.</em> The contracting officer at the requesting agency may rescind or recall a delegation to administer a contract or perform a contract administration function, except for the cognizant Federal agency functions identified in 42.302(a). The requesting agency must coordinate with the CAO to establish a reasonable transition period prior to rescinding or recalling the delegation.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Secondary delegations of contract administration.</em></p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A CAO that has been delegated administration of a contract function may request supporting contract administration from the cognizant CAO at the location. The request must-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Be in writing;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Clearly state the specific administration functions to be performed; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Be accompanied by a copy of pertinent contractual and other necessary documents.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The prime contractor is responsible for managing its subcontracts. The CAO’s review of subcontracts is normally limited to evaluating the prime contractor’s management of the subcontracts (see part 44). Therefore, supporting contract administration may only be used for subcontracts when-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The Government otherwise would incur undue cost;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Successful completion of the prime contract is threatened; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> It is authorized under paragraph (f) of this section or elsewhere in this regulation.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> <em class="ph i">Special surveillance.</em> For major system acquisitions (see part 34), the contracting officer may designate certain high risk or critical subsystems or components for special surveillance in addition to requesting supporting contract administration. This surveillance must be conducted in a manner consistent with the policy of requesting that the cognizant CAO perform contract administration functions at a contractor’s facility (see 42.002).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> <em class="ph i">Refusing delegation of contract administration</em>. An agency may decline a request for contract administration services on a case-by-case basis if they lack adequate resources to accomplish the tasks. Declinations must be in writing.</p></div>
