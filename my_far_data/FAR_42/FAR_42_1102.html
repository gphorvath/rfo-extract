<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General.</em> Past performance evaluations must be prepared at least annually and at the time the work under a contract or order is completed. Interim evaluations are permissible.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Past performance evaluations are required for contracts and orders as specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, including contracts and orders performed outside the United States.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Past performance evaluations are completed for the entity, division, or unit that performed the contract or order.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Agencies must enter past performance information into CPARS, the Governmentwide evaluation reporting tool for all past performance reports on contracts and orders. Instructions for submitting evaluations into CPARS are available at <em class="ph i"><a href="http://www.cpars.gov/">http://www.cpars.gov/</a>.</em></p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Contracts.</em></p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (h) of this section, agencies must prepare evaluations of contractor performance for each contract and order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold and for each order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Agencies must prepare an evaluation if a modification to the contract causes the dollar amount to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Orders under multiple-agency contracts.</em></p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Agencies must prepare an evaluation of contractor performance for each order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold that placed under a Federal Supply Schedule contract or placed under a task-order contract, or a delivery-order contract awarded by another agency (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> Governmentwide acquisition contract or multi-agency contract).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)(i)</span> Agencies placing orders under their own multiple-agency contract must prepare evaluations for their own orders. This evaluation must not consider the requirements under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Agencies must prepare an evaluation if a modification to an order causes the value to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Orders under single-agency contracts.</em> For single-agency task-order and delivery-order contracts, the contracting officer may require performance evaluations for each order in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold when such evaluations would produce more meaningful past performance information for source selection officials than that contained in the overall contract evaluation (e.g., when the scope of the basic contract is very broad and the nature of individual orders could be significantly different). This evaluation does not have to consider the requirements under paragraph (g) of this section unless the contracting officer deems it appropriate.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Construction contracts</em>. Agencies must prepare past performance evaluations for each construction contract of $900,000 or more, and for each construction contract terminated for default regardless of contract value. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for construction contracts below $900,000.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> <em class="ph i">Architect-engineer services contracts</em>. Past performance evaluations must be prepared for each architect-engineer services contract of $45,000 or more, and for each architect-engineer services contract that is terminated for default regardless of contract value. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for architect-engineer services contracts below $45,000.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> <em class="ph i">Content</em>. Past performance evaluations must include an assessment of the contractor's—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Performance against, and efforts to achieve, the goals identified in the small business subcontracting plan when the contract includes the clause at 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Reduced or untimely payments (as defined in part 19), made to small business subcontractors, determined by the contracting officer to be unjustified. The contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Consider and evaluate a contractor's written explanation for a reduced or an untimely payment when determining whether the reduced or untimely payment is justified; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Determine that a history of unjustified reduced or untimely payments has occurred when the contractor has reported three or more occasions of unjustified reduced or untimely payments under a single contract within a 12-month period (see 42.1503(h)(1)(vi) and the evaluation ratings in Table 42-2). The following payment or nonpayment situations are not considered to be unjustified:</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> There is a contract dispute on performance.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> A partial payment is made for amounts not in dispute.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> A payment is reduced due to past overpayments.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(D)</span> There is an administrative mistake.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(E)</span> Late performance by the subcontractor leads to later payment by the prime contractor.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(h)</span> Agencies must promptly report other contractor information in accordance with 42.1103(g).</p></div>
