Cognizant Government agencies and educational institutions are listed in the CASD (see 42.202).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The cognizant agency for indirect costs establishes billing rates and final indirect cost rates at the educational institutions, using the procedures at 42.505-1 (b).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> If the cognizant agency is unable to reach agreement with an institution, the cognizant agency will resolve disputes in accordance with agency procedures and the OMB Uniform Guidance.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Predetermined final indirect cost rates</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Agencies may use predetermined rates for cost-reimbursement research and development contracts with universities, colleges, or other educational institutions (41 U.S.C. 4708). If established, they extend to all the institution’s Government contracts.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> In deciding whether the use of predetermined rates are appropriate, consider the stability of indirect costs and bases over a period of years and anticipated changes.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Unless approved at a level in the cognizant agency higher than the contracting officer, do not use predetermined rates when-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> There has been no recent audit of the indirect costs;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> There have been frequent or wide fluctuations in the indirect cost rates and the bases over a period of years; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The estimated reimbursable costs for any individual contract are expected to exceed $1 million annually.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> If no predetermined rates exist for the institution’s current fiscal year-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The institution must provide the agency a proposal for predetermined rates.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If the proposal is found to be generally acceptable, the agency must negotiate the predetermined rates with the institution. The rates should be based on an audit of the institution’s costs for the year immediately preceding year that the rates are being negotiated. If this is not possible, or, if not available, earlier audits, if determined appropriate by the cognizant agency may be used, but appropriate steps should be taken to identify and evaluate significant variations in costs incurred or in bases used that may have a bearing on the reasonableness of the proposed rates. However, in the case of smaller contracts (i.e., contracts that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold), an audit made at an earlier date is acceptable if-</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> There have been no significant changes in the contractor’s organization; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> It is reasonably apparent that another audit would have little effect on the rates finally agreed upon and the potential for overpayment of indirect cost is relatively insignificant.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> If predetermined rates are used-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contracting officer must include the negotiated rates and bases in the contract Schedule; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> See part 16, which prescribes the clause at 52.216-15, Predetermined Indirect Cost Rates.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> Predetermined indirect cost rates are applicable for a period of not more than four years. The agency must obtain new rate proposals sufficiently in advance so that the new rates, based on current data, may be promptly negotiated near the beginning of the next fiscal year or other period agreed to by the parties (see paragraphs (b) and (d) of the clause at 52.216-15, Predetermined Indirect Cost Rates).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> Use billing rates for periods not covered by predetermined rates.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(8)</span> The OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and appendix III, provides additional guidance on how long predetermined rates may be used.</p></div>
