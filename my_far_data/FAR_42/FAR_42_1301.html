<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The contracting officer, administrative contracting officer (ACO), or the contractor may initiate a request for a forward pricing rate agreement (FPRA). Normally, FPRAs are negotiated only with contractors having a significant volume of Government contract proposals. The cognizant Federal agency should determine whether to establish an FPRA by considering whether the benefits to be derived from the agreement are commensurate with the effort of establishing and monitoring it.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The ACO must obtain the contractorâ€™s forward pricing rate proposal and require that it include cost or pricing data that are accurate, complete, and current as of the date of submission, but must not require a certification (see part 15). The ACO must invite the cognizant contract auditor and contracting offices having a significant interest to participate in developing a Government objective and in the negotiations. Upon completing negotiations, the ACO must prepare a price negotiation memorandum (PNM) (see part 15) and forward copies of the PNM and FPRA to the cognizant auditor and to all contracting offices that are known to be affected by the FPRA.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The FPRA must provide specific terms and conditions covering expiration, application, and data requirements for systematic monitoring to ensure the validity of the rates. The agreement must provide for cancellation at the choice of either party and must require the contractor to submit to the ACO and to the cognizant contract auditor any significant change in cost or pricing data used to support the FPRA.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> When an FPRA is invalid, the contractor should submit and negotiate a new proposal to reflect the changed conditions. If an FPRA has not been established or has been invalidated, the ACO will issue a forward pricing rate recommendation (FPRR) to buying activities with documentation to assist negotiators. In the absence of an FPRA or FPRR, the ACO must provide support to the contracting officer for rates utilized.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> The ACO may negotiate continuous updates to the FPRA. The FPRA will provide specific terms and conditions covering notification, application, and data requirements for systematic monitoring to ensure the validity of the rates.</p></div>
