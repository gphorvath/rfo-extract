Contracting officers may agree to these as “make items” if an overall lower Governmentwide cost would result or it is otherwise in the best interest of the Government. If this situation occurs in any fixed-price incentive or cost-plus-incentive-fee contract, contracting officers must specify these items in the contract and state that they are subject to paragraph (d) of the clause at 52.215-9, <em class="ph i">Changes or Additions to Make-or-Buy Program</em>. If the contractor proposes to reverse the categorization of such items during contract performance, the contract price must be subject to equitable reduction.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Incorporating make-or-buy programs in contracts</em>.
