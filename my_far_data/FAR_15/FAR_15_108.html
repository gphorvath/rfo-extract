Contracting officers must establish the method and time for resubmission after consultation with the offeror and document the file. For the purpose of determining timeliness under 15.107, the resubmission is considered as if it were received at the date and time of the original unreadable submission, provided the offeror complies with the time and format requirements established by the contracting officer for resubmission.</p></div>
