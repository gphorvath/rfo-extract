The completed field pricing assistance results may reference audit information, but need not reconcile the audit recommendations and technical recommendations. A copy of the information submitted to the contracting officer by field pricing personnel must be provided to the audit agency.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Audit and field pricing information, whether written or reported telephonically or electronically, must be made a part of the official contract file.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Audit assistance for prime contracts or subcontracts</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Contracting officers should contact the cognizant audit office directly to request assistance, particularly when an audit is the only field pricing support required. The audit office must send the audit report, or otherwise transmit the audit recommendations, directly to the contracting officer.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The auditor must not reveal the audit conclusions or recommendations to the offeror/contractor without obtaining the concurrence of the contracting officer. However, the auditor may discuss statements of facts with the contractor.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Contracting officers must be notified immediately of any information disclosed to the auditor after submission of a report that may significantly affect the audit findings and, if necessary, a supplemental audit report must be issued.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Contracting officers must not request a separate preaward audit of indirect costs unless the information already available from an existing audit, completed within the preceding 12 months, is considered inadequate for determining the reasonableness of the proposed indirect costs (41 U.S.C. 4706 and 10 U.S.C. 3841).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The auditor is responsible for the scope and depth of the audit. Copies of updated information that will significantly affect the audit must be provided to the auditor by the contracting officer.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> General access to the offeror's books and financial records is limited to the auditor. This limitation does not preclude the contracting officer or the ACO, or their representatives, from requesting that the offeror provide or make available any data or records necessary to analyze the offeror's proposal.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Deficient proposals</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The ACO or the auditor, as appropriate, must notify the contracting officer immediately if the data provided for review is so deficient as to preclude review or audit, or if the contractor or offeror has denied access to any records considered essential to conduct a satisfactory review or audit. Oral notifications must be confirmed promptly in writing, including a description of deficient or denied data or records.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The contracting officer must immediately take appropriate action to obtain the required data. Should the offeror/contractor again refuse to provide adequate data, or provide access to necessary data, the contracting officer must withhold the award or price adjustment and refer the contract action to a higher authority, providing details of the attempts made to resolve the matter and a statement of the practicability of obtaining the supplies or services from another source.</p></div>
