<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General</em>. Price analysis is the process of examining and evaluating a proposed price without evaluating its separate cost elements and proposed profit.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Techniques</em>. The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair and reasonable price, including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the RFP.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Comparison of the proposed prices to historical prices paid, whether by the Government or other than the Government, for the same or similar items. This method may be used for commercial products or commercial services including those “of a type” or when requiring minor modifications for commercial products.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The prior price must be a valid basis for comparison. If there has been a significant time lapse between the last acquisition and the present one, if the terms and conditions of the acquisition are significantly different, or if the reasonableness of the prior price is uncertain, then the prior price may not be a valid basis for comparison.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The prior price must be adjusted to account for materially differing terms and conditions, quantities and market and economic factors. For similar items, the contracting officer must also adjust the prior price to account for material differences between the similar item and the item being procured.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Expert technical advice should be obtained when analyzing similar items, or commercial products or commercial services that are “of a type”, or requiring minor modifications for commercial products, to ascertain the magnitude of changes required and to assist in pricing the required changes.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Use of parametric estimating methods/application of rough yardsticks (such as dollars per pound or per horsepower, or other units) to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional pricing inquiry.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> Analysis of data other than certified cost or pricing data provided by the offeror.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Preferred method of analysis</em>. The techniques at 15.404-1(b)(1) and (2) are the preferred methods for price analysis. However, if the contracting officer determines that information on competitive proposed prices or previous contract prices is not available or is insufficient to determine that the price is fair and reasonable, the contracting officer may use any of the remaining techniques as appropriate to the circumstances applicable to the acquisition.The fact that a price is included in a catalog does not, in and of itself, make it fair and reasonable.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Value analysis</em>. Value analysis can give insight into the relative worth of a product and the Government may use it in conjunction with the price analysis techniques listed in paragraph (b) of this section.</p></div>
