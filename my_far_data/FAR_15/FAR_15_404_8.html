<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Policy</em>. Contracting officers are responsible for the determination of a fair and reasonable price for the prime contract, including subcontracting costs. To support this effort, the prime contractor or subcontractor must—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Conduct appropriate cost or price analyses to establish the reasonableness of proposed subcontract prices;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Include the results of these analyses in the price proposal; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> When required by paragraph (b) of this subsection, submit subcontractor certified cost or pricing data to the Government as part of its own certified cost or pricing data.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Certified cost or pricing data</em>. Any contractor or subcontractor that is required to submit certified cost or pricing data also must obtain and analyze certified cost or pricing data before awarding any subcontract, purchase order, or modification expected to exceed the certified cost or pricing data threshold, unless an exception in 15.403-2 applies to that action.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contractor must submit, or cause to be submitted by the subcontractor(s), certified cost or pricing data to the Government for subcontracts that are the lower of either—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> $20 million or more; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price, unless the contracting officer believes such submission is unnecessary.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Contracting officers should require the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the Government (or cause submission of) subcontractor certified cost or pricing data below the thresholds in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and data other than certified cost or pricing data that the contracting officer considers necessary for adequately pricing the prime contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be submitted in the format provided in Table 15-1 of 15.408-2 or the alternate format specified in the RFP.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be current, accurate, and complete as of the date of price agreement, or, if applicable, an earlier date agreed upon by the parties and specified on the contractor's Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. Contractors must update subcontractor's data, as appropriate, during source selection and negotiations.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> If there is more than one prospective subcontractor for any given work, the contractor need only submit to the Government certified cost or pricing data for the prospective subcontractor most likely to receive the award.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Approved purchasing system</em>. Contracting officers should consider whether a contractor or subcontractor has an approved purchasing system, has performed cost or price analysis of proposed subcontractor prices, or has negotiated the subcontract prices before negotiation of the prime contract, in determining the reasonableness of the prime contract price. This does not relieve contracting officers from the responsibility to analyze the contractor's submission, including subcontractor's certified cost or pricing data.</p></div>
