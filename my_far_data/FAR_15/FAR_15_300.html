<div class="body"><p class="p">This subpart addresses postaward actions and considerations for negotiated contracts. The procedures for postaward debriefings, protests, and mistakes do not apply to contracts awarded using the other competitive procedures described in subpart 6.1 for architect-engineer contracts and basic and applied research. The procedures for postaward debriefings, protests, and mistakes, with reasonable modification, should be followed for contracts awarded using those other competitive procedures.</p></div>
