                <h2>15.104Establishing competitive evaluation factors and significant subfactors.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General.</em>A competitive award decision is based on evaluation factors and significant subfactors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation factors and significant subfactors must represent the key areas of importance and emphasis to be considered in the source selection decision; and support meaningful differentiation between competing proposals. All factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award and their relative importance must be stated clearly in the RFP (10 U.S.C. 3206(b)(1) and 41 U.S.C. 3306(b)(1)).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Required factors</em>. The evaluation factors and significant subfactors that apply to an acquisition and their relative importance are within the broad discretion of agency acquisition officials, subject to the following requirements:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Price or cost</em>.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Price or cost to the Government must be evaluated in every competitive source selection (10 U.S.C. 3206(c)(1)(B) and41 U.S.C. 3306(c)(1)(B)). Proposed price reductions under an offeror's other contracts cannot be used as an evaluation factor.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3206(c), for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard–</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Contracting officers may choose not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for award when an RFP–</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Has an estimated value above the simplified acquisition threshold;</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Will result in multiple-award contracts that are for the same or similar services; and</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> States that the Government intends to make an award to each and all qualifying offerors.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> If the contracting officer chooses not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for the contract award, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the contracting officer must consider price or cost as one of the factors in the selection decision for each order placed under the contract.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> The exception in paragraph (B)(1)(ii)(A) of this section must not apply to RFPs for multiple-award contracts that provide for sole source orders pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Quality</em>. The quality of the product or service must be evaluated in every competitive source selection through consideration of one or more non-cost evaluation factors such as past performance, compliance with RFP requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications, and prior experience ((10 U.S.C. 3206(c)(1)(A) and 41 U.S.C. 3306(c)(1)(A)).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> <em class="ph i">Past performance</em>.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Past performance must be evaluated in every competitive source selection, unless the contracting officer documents the reason past performance is not an appropriate evaluation factor for the acquisition. This evaluation is separate from the responsibility determination required under part 9.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The RFP must—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Describe the general approach for evaluating past performance information, including evaluating offerors with no relevant performance history;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Provide offerors an opportunity to: identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government, private sector, and other contracts) for efforts similar to the Government requirement, and provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror corrective actions; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The RFP may describe the agency’s approach to considering the currency and relevance, source, and context of the information to be requested.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Situational factors</em>. For competitive RFPs that are not set aside for small business concerns, involving consolidation or bundling, that offer a significant opportunity for subcontracting, the contracting officer must include—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A factor to evaluate past performance indicating the extent to which the offeror attained applicable goals for small business participation under contracts that required subcontracting plans (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(G)(ii)); and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> A factor to evaluate the proposed small business subcontracting participation in the subcontracting plan (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(G)(i)).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Factor importance</em>. In addition to stating the relative importance of each evaluation factor, and unless the exception at paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section applies, the RFP must also state, at a minimum, whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Significantly more important than cost or price;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Approximately equal to cost or price; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Significantly less important than cost or price (10 U.S.C. 3206(c)(1)(C) and 41 U.S.C. 3306(c)(1)(C)).</p></div>
