If the contracting officer determines that a product or service claimed to be commercial is not, and that no other exception or waiver for certified cost or pricing data applies, the contracting officer must require submission of certified cost or pricing data.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> In accordance with section 41 U.S.C. 3501:</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> When purchasing services that are not offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace, but are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace, they may be considered commercial services (thus meeting the purpose of 41 U.S.C. chapter 35 and 10 U.S.C. chapter 271 for truth in negotiations) only if the contracting officer determines in writing that the offeror has submitted sufficient information to evaluate, through price analysis, the reasonableness of the price of such services.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> In order to make this determination, contracting officers may request the offeror to submit prices paid for the same or similar commercial services under comparable terms and conditions by both Government and commercial customers; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> If the contracting officer determines that the information described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, other relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including information on labor costs, material costs and overhead rates may be requested.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The following requirements apply to minor modifications defined in paragraph (3)(ii) of the definition of a commercial product at 2.101 that do not change the commercial product to other than commercial:</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> For acquisitions funded by any agency other than DoD, NASA, or Coast Guard, such modifications of a commercial product are exempt from the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> For acquisitions funded by DoD, NASA, or Coast Guard, such modifications of a commercial product are exempt from the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data provided the total price of all such modifications under a particular contract action does not exceed the greater of the threshold for obtaining certified cost or pricing data in 15.403-3(a) or 5 percent of the total price of the contract at the time of contract award.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> For acquisitions funded by DoD, NASA, or Coast Guard such modifications of a commercial product are not exempt from the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data on the basis of the exemption provided for at 15.403-2(c)(3) if the total price of all such modifications under a particular contract action exceeds the greater of the threshold for obtaining certified cost or pricing data in 15.403-3(a) or 5 percent of the total price of the contract at the time of contract award.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Any acquisition for other than commercial products or services treated as commercial products or commercial services at 12.001(b), except sole source contracts greater than $25 million, is exempt from the requirements for certified cost or pricing data (41 U.S.C. 1903).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> <em class="ph i">Waivers</em>.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> In exceptional cases, the HCA may, without power of delegation, waive the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data if the price can be determined to be fair and reasonable without submission of certified cost or pricing data.
