                <h2>15.205Source selection decision.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">The source selection decision must represent the SSAâ€™s independent judgement and be based on a comparative assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the RFP. The source selection decision must be documented and include the rationale for any business judgments and tradeoffs made or relied on by the SSA, including benefits associated with additional costs. The documentation does not need to quantify the tradeoffs that led to the decision.</p></div>
