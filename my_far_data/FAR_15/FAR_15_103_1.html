                <h2>15.103-1 Tradeoff approach.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">The tradeoff approach to source selection is appropriate when it may be in the Governmentâ€™s best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror. This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost or non-price factors. The anticipated benefits of a higher priced proposal must merit the additional cost.</p></div>
