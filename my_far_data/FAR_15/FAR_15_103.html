                <h2>15.103 Developing a competitive source selection approach.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">The goal of source selection is to select the proposal that represents the best value to the Government. To obtain best value, agencies use a range of approaches for evaluating competitive offers, where the importance of cost or price varies relative to other factors such as technical merit and past performance. Agencies can obtain best value in competitive negotiated acquisitions by using any one or a combination of source selection approaches, including but not limited to the approaches mentioned in this section.</p></div>
