<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General</em>. Cost realism analysis is the process of independently reviewing and evaluating specific elements of each offeror's proposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror's technical proposal.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Probable Cost</em>. Cost realism analyses must be performed on cost-reimbursement contacts to determine the probable cost of performance for each offeror.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The probable cost may differ from the proposed cost and should reflect the Government's best estimate of the cost of any contract that is most likely to result from the offeror's proposal. The probable cost must be used for purposes of evaluation to determine the best value.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The probable cost is determined by adjusting each offeror's proposed cost, and fee when appropriate, to reflect any additions or reductions in cost elements to realistic levels based on the results of the cost realism analysis.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Competitive fixed-price-type contracts</em>. Cost realism analyses may also be used on competitive fixed-price incentive contracts or, in exceptional cases, on other competitive fixed-price-type contracts when new requirements may not be fully understood by competing offerors, there are quality concerns, or past experience indicates that contractors' proposed costs have resulted in quality or service shortfalls. Results of the analysis may be used in performance risk assessments and responsibility determinations. However, proposals must be evaluated using the criteria in the RFP, and the offered prices must not be adjusted as a result of the analysis.</p></div>
