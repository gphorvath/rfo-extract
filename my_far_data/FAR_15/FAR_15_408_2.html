The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data is met when all accurate certified cost or pricing data reasonably available to the offeror have been submitted, either actually or by specific identification, to the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative. As later data come into your possession, it should be submitted promptly to the Contracting Officer in a manner that clearly shows how the data relate to the offeror's price proposal. The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date agreed upon between the parties if applicable.</p><p class="ListL1"><em class="ph i">Note 2</em>: By submitting your proposal, you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award. It may include those books, records, documents, and other types of factual data (regardless of form or whether the data are specifically referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing) that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.</p><p class="ListL1"><strong class="ph b">I. General Instructions</strong></p><p class="ListL1">A. You must provide the following information on the first page of your pricing proposal:</p><p class="ListL1">(1) RFP, contract, and/or modification number;</p><p class="ListL1">(2) Name and address of offeror;</p><p class="ListL1">(3) Name, telephone number, and email address of the point of contact;</p><p class="ListL1">(4) Name of contract administration office (if available);</p><p class="ListL1">(5) Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price revision/redetermination, letter contract, unpriced order, or other);</p><p class="ListL1">(6) Proposed cost; profit or fee; and total;</p><p class="ListL1">(7) Whether you will require the use of Government property in the performance of the contract, and, if so, what property;</p><p class="ListL1">(8) Whether your organization is subject to cost accounting standards; whether your organization has submitted a CASB Disclosure Statement, and if it has been determined adequate; whether you have been notified that you are or may be in noncompliance with your Disclosure Statement or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and, if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR part 31, <em class="ph i">Cost Principles</em>, and, if not, an explanation;</p><p class="ListL1">(9) The following statement: This proposal reflects our estimates and/or actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in the RFP and FAR 15.408-2, Table 15-1. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting Officer and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price.</p><p class="ListL1">(10) Date of submission; and</p><p class="ListL1">(11) Name, title, and signature of authorized representative.</p><p class="ListL1">B. In submitting your proposal, you must include an index, appropriately referenced, of all the certified cost or pricing data and information accompanying or identified in the proposal. In addition, you must annotate any future additions and/or revisions, up to the date of agreement on price, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, on a supplemental index.</p><p class="ListL1">C. As part of the specific information required, you must submit, with your proposal—</p><p class="ListL1">(1) Certified cost or pricing data (as defined at FAR 2.101). You must clearly identify on your cover sheet that certified cost or pricing data are included as part of the proposal.</p><p class="ListL1">(2) Information reasonably required to explain your estimating process, including—</p><p class="ListL1">(i) The judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known data; and</p><p class="ListL1">(ii) The nature and amount of any contingencies included in the proposed price.</p><p class="ListL1">D. You must show the relationship between line item prices and the total contract price. You must attach cost-element breakdowns for each proposed line item, using the appropriate format prescribed in the “Formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries” section of this table. You must furnish supporting breakdowns for each cost element, consistent with your cost accounting system.</p><p class="ListL1">E. When more than one line item is proposed, you must also provide summary total amounts covering all line items for each element of cost.</p><p class="ListL1">F. Whenever you have incurred costs for work performed before submission of a proposal, you must identify those costs in your cost/price proposal.</p><p class="ListL1">G. If you have reached an agreement with Government representatives on use of forward pricing rates/factors, identify the agreement, include a copy, and describe its nature.</p><p class="ListL1">H. As soon as practicable after final agreement on price or an earlier date agreed to by the parties, but before the award resulting from the proposal, you must, under the conditions stated in FAR 15.403-4, submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data.</p><p class="ListL1"><strong class="ph b">II. Cost Elements</strong></p><p class="ListL1">Depending on your system, you must provide breakdowns for the following basic cost elements, as applicable:</p><p class="ListL1">A. <em class="ph i">Materials and services</em>. Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or line items being proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor quotes, invoice prices, etc.). Include raw materials, parts, components, assemblies, and services to be produced or performed by others. For all items proposed, identify the item and show the source, quantity, and price. Conduct price analyses of all subcontractor proposals. Conduct cost analyses for all subcontracts when certified cost or pricing data are submitted by the subcontractor. Include these analyses as part of your own certified cost or pricing data submissions for subcontracts expected to exceed the appropriate threshold in FAR 15.403-3(a). Submit the subcontractor certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost or pricing data as part of your own certified cost or pricing data as required in paragraph IIA(2) of this table. These requirements also apply to all subcontractors if required to submit certified cost or pricing data.</p><p class="ListL1">(1) <em class="ph i">Adequate Price Competition</em>. Provide data showing the degree of competition and the basis for establishing the source and reasonableness of price for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding, or expected to exceed, the appropriate threshold set forth at FAR 15.403-3(a) priced on the basis of adequate price competition. For interorganizational transfers priced at other than the cost of comparable competitive commercial work of the division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor, explain the pricing method (see FAR 31).</p><p class="ListL1">(2) <em class="ph i">All Other</em>. Obtain certified cost or pricing data from prospective sources for those acquisitions (such as subcontracts, purchase orders, material order, etc.) exceeding the threshold set forth in FAR 15.403-3(a) and not otherwise exempt, in accordance with FAR 15.403-2. Also provide data showing the basis for establishing source and reasonableness of price. In addition, provide a summary of your cost analysis and a copy of certified cost or pricing data submitted by the prospective source in support of each subcontract, or purchase order that is the lower of either $20 million or more, or both more than the pertinent certified cost or pricing data threshold and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price. Also submit any information reasonably required to explain your estimating process (including the judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount of any contingencies included in the price). The Contracting Officer may require you to submit cost or pricing data in support of proposals in lower amounts. Subcontractor certified cost or pricing data must be accurate, complete and current as of the date of final price agreement, or an earlier date agreed upon by the parties, given on the prime contractor's Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. The prime contractor is responsible for updating a prospective subcontractor's data. For standard commercial products fabricated by the offeror that are generally stocked in inventory, provide a separate cost breakdown, if priced based on cost. For interorganizational transfers priced at cost, provide a separate breakdown of cost elements. Analyze the certified cost or pricing data and submit the results of your analysis of the prospective source's proposal. When submission of a prospective source's certified cost or pricing data is required as described in this paragraph, it must be included as part of your own certified cost or pricing data. You must also submit any data other than certified cost or pricing data obtained from a subcontractor, either actually or by specific identification, along with the results of any analysis performed on that data.</p><p class="ListL1">B. <em class="ph i">Direct Labor</em>. Provide a time-phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly, etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category, and furnish bases for estimates.</p><p class="ListL1">C. <em class="ph i">Indirect Costs</em>. Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect costs, including cost breakdowns. Show trends and budgetary data to provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of proposed rates. Indicate the rates used and provide an appropriate explanation.</p><p class="ListL1">D. <em class="ph i">Other Costs</em>. List all other costs not otherwise included in the categories described above (e.g., special tooling, travel, computer and consultant services, preservation, packaging and packing, spoilage and rework, and Federal excise tax on finished articles) and provide bases for pricing.</p><p class="ListL1">E. <em class="ph i">Royalties</em>. If royalties exceed $1,500, you must provide the following information on a separate page for each separate royalty or license fee:</p><p class="ListL1">(1) Name and address of licensor.</p><p class="ListL1">(2) Date of license agreement.</p><p class="ListL1">(3) Patent numbers.</p><p class="ListL1">(4) Patent application serial numbers, or other basis on which the royalty is payable.</p><p class="ListL1">(5) Brief description (including any part or model numbers of each contract item or component on which the royalty is payable).</p><p class="ListL1">(6) Percentage or dollar rate of royalty per unit.</p><p class="ListL1">(7) Unit price of contract item.</p><p class="ListL1">(8) Number of units.</p><p class="ListL1">(9) Total dollar amount of royalties.</p><p class="ListL1">(10) If specifically requested by the Contracting Officer, a copy of the current license agreement and identification of applicable claims of specific patents (see part 27 and 31).</p><p class="ListL1">F. <em class="ph i">Facilities Capital Cost of Money</em>. When you elect to claim facilities capital cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit Form CASB CMF and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see 31.205-10 and 48 CFR 9904.414).</p><p class="ListL1"><strong class="ph b">III.
