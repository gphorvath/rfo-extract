Having further negotiation<s><span class="ph line-through">s</span></s> with a particular offeror does not obligate contracting officers to have further negotiations with any other offerors.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Contracting officers may also negotiate other aspects of the offeror's proposal that could, in the opinion of the contracting officer, be altered or explained to enhance materially the proposal's potential for award. Contracting officers are not required to negotiate every area where the proposal could be improved.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> When an RFP stated that evaluation credit would be given for technical solutions exceeding any mandatory minimums, contracting officers may negotiate with offerors for increased performance beyond any mandatory minimums, and suggest to offerors that have exceeded any mandatory minimums (in ways that are not integral to the design), that their proposals would be more competitive if the excesses were removed and the proposed price decreased.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Elimination from the competitive range</em>. A proposal must be eliminated from consideration for award when the contracting officer determines that a proposal should no longer be included in the competitive range.

Contracting officers are not required to have an additional negotiation with an offeror prior to taking such action.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Proposal revision</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> When negotiations with an offeror are finished, and that offeror has not been eliminated from the competitive range, contracting officers must provide the offeror with—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> An opportunity to submit a proposal revision; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> A notice requiring the proposal revision in writing and stating that the Government intends to make award without obtaining further revisions.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Each offeror with a proposal still within the competitive range must be given an equal amount of time within which to submit their proposal revision.</p></div>
