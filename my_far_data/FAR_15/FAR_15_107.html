                <h2>15.107Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Submission.</em> Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any revisions or modifications, so as to reach the Government office designated in the RFP by the time specified in the RFP.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">Method</em>. Offerors may use any transmission method authorized in the RFP.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Time</em>. If no time is specified in the RFP, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposals are due.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Late submission</em>.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">General</em>. Any proposal, modification, or revision, that is received at the designated Government office after the exact time specified for receipt of proposals is “late” and will not be considered, unless it is received before award is made, the contracting officer determines that accepting the late proposal would not unduly delay the acquisition, and—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the RFP, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of proposals and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of proposals; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> It was the only proposal received.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Exception</em>. A late modification of an otherwise successful proposal, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted by the contracting officer.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> <em class="ph i">Proof of receipt</em>. Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes electronic timestamps, the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> <em class="ph i">Notification</em>. Contracting officers must promptly notify any offeror if its proposal, modification, or revision was received late, and inform the offeror whether its proposal will be considered, unless contract award is imminent and the award notice at 15.207-2 will suffice.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> <em class="ph i">Documentation</em>.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> When available, the file for each late proposal, modification, revision, or withdrawal received must include the date and hour of receipt; a statement regarding whether the proposal was considered for award, with supporting rationale; and the envelope, wrapper, or other evidence of date of receipt.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Late proposals and modifications that are not considered must be held unopened, unless opened for identification, until after award and then retained with other unsuccessful proposals.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Interruption</em>. If proposals cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the RFP because an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the RFP closing date, the time specified for RFP will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the RFP on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Withdrawal</em>. Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice at any time before award. A copy of withdrawn proposals should be retained in the contract file.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Extra copies of the withdrawn proposals may be destroyed or returned to the offeror at the offeror’s request. Extremely bulky proposals must only be returned at the offeror's request and expense.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Oral proposals in response to oral RFPs may be withdrawn orally. Contracting officers must document the contract file when oral withdrawals are made.</p></div>
