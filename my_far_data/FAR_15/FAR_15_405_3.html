<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> All data submitted in connection with the Forward Rate Pricing Agreement (FPRA), updated as necessary, form a part of the total data that the offeror certifies to be accurate, complete, and current at the time of agreement on price for an initial contract or for a contract modification.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Contracting officers will use FPRA rates as bases for pricing all contracts, modifications, and other contractual actions to be performed during the period covered by the agreement. Conditions that may affect the agreement's validity must be reported promptly to the administrative contracting officer (ACO). If the ACO determines that a changed condition invalidates the agreement, the ACO must notify all interested parties of the extent of its effect and status of efforts to establish a revised FPRA.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Contracting officers must not require certification at the time of agreement for data supplied in support of FPRA's or other advance agreements. When a forward pricing rate agreement or other advance agreement is used to price a contract action that requires a certificate, the certificate supporting that contract action must cover the data supplied to support the FPRA or other advance agreement, and all other data supporting the action.</p></div>
