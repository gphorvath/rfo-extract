<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Property to which the Government obtains title by operation of the Progress Payments clause solely is not, as a consequence, Government-furnished property.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Although property title is vested in the Government under the Progress Payments clause, the acquisition, handling, and disposition of certain types of property are governed by—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The clause at 52.245-1, Government Property; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The termination clauses at 52.249, for termination inventory.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The contractor may sell or otherwise dispose of current production scrap in the ordinary course of business on its own volition, even if title has vested in the Government under the Progress Payments clause. The contracting officer must require the contractor to credit the costs of the contract performance with the proceeds of the scrap disposition.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> When the title to materials or other inventories is vested in the Government under the Progress Payments clause, the contractor may transfer the inventory items from the contract for its own use or other disposition only if, and on terms, approved by the contracting officer. The contractor is required to—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Eliminate the costs allocable to the transferred property from the costs of contract performance, and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Repay or credit to the Government an amount equal to the unliquidated progress payments, allocable to the transferred property.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> If excess property remains after the contract performance is complete and all contractor obligations under the contract are satisfied, including full liquidation of progress payments, the excess property is outside the scope of the Progress Payments clause. Therefore, the contractor holds title to it.</p></div>
