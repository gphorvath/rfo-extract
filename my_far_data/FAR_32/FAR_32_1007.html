The contracting officer should consider the contractor's experience, performance record, reliability, financial strength, and the adequacy of controls established by the contractor for the administration of performance-based payments. Based upon the risk to the Government, post-payment reviews and verifications should normally be arranged as considered appropriate by the contracting officer. If considered necessary by the contracting officer, pre-payment reviews may be required.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Incomplete performance.</em> The contracting officer must not approve a performance-based payment until the specified event or performance criterion has been successfully accomplished in accordance with the contract. If an event is cumulative, the contracting officer must not approve the performance-based payment unless all identified preceding events or criteria are accomplished.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Government-caused delay.</em> Entitlement to a performance-based payment is solely on the basis of successful performance of the specified events or performance criteria. However, if there is a Government-caused delay, the contracting officer may renegotiate the performance-based payment schedule to facilitate contractor billings for any successfully accomplished portions of the delayed event or criterion.</p></div>
