In most situations, advance payment is the least preferred method of contract financing (see 32.106) and generally they should not be authorized if other types of financing are reasonably available to the contractor in adequate amounts. Loans and credit at excessive interest rates or other exorbitant charges, or loans from other Government agencies, are not considered reasonably available financing. (c) If statutory requirements and standards for advance payment determinations are met, the contracting officer must generally recommend that the agency authorize advance payments.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e32"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> If statutory requirements and standards for advance payment determinations are met, the contracting officer must generally recommend that the agency authorize advance payments.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e38"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The statutory requirements are that-</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e44"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contractor gives adequate security;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e49"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The advance payments will not exceed the unpaid contract price (see 32.410(b), paragraph (a)(2)); and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e57"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The agency head or designee determines, based on written findings, that the advance payment-</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e63"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Is in the public interest (under 32.401(a) or (b)); or</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e71"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Facilitates the national defense (under 32.401(c)).</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e79"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The standards for advance payment determinations are that-</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e85"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The advance payments will not exceed the contractor’s interim cash needs based on-</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e91"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Analysis of the cash flow required for contract performance;</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e96"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Consideration of the reimbursement or other payment cycle; and</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e101"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> To the extent possible, employment of the contractor’s own working capital;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e106"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The advance payments are necessary to supplement other funds or credit available to a contractor;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e111"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The recipient is otherwise qualified as a responsible contractor; and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e116"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The Government will benefit from performance prospects or there are other practical advantages.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e129"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> If necessary, the agency may authorize advance payments in addition to progress or partial payments on the same contract (see 32.501-1(c)).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e137"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> Each agency that provides advance payments must-</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_402__d2090e143"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Place the responsibility for making findings and determinations, and for approval of contract terms concerning advance payments (see 32.410), at an organizational level high enough to ensure uniform application of this subpart (see the limitation at 50.102-1(b) which also applies to advance payments authorized under Pub.L.85-804 (  <a aria-label="50 U.S.C. 1431.
