                <h2>32.503-9 Liquidation rates—alternate method.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The liquidation rate determined under 32.503-8 must apply throughout the period of contract performance unless the contracting officer adjusts the liquidation rate under the alternate method in this 32.503-9. The objective of the alternate liquidation rate method is to permit the contractor to retain the earned profit element of the contract prices for completed items in the liquidation process. The contracting officer may reduce the liquidation rate if—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contractor requests a reduction in the rate;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The rate has not been reduced in the preceding 12 months;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The contract delivery schedule extends at least 18 months from the contract award date;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Data on actual costs are available--</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> For the products delivered, or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If no deliveries have been made, for a performance period of at least 12 months;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> The reduced liquidation rate would result in the Government recouping under each invoice the full extent of the progress payments applicable to the costs allocable to that invoice;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> The contractor would not be paid for more than the costs of items delivered and accepted (less allocable progress payments) and the earned profit on those items;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> The unliquidated progress payments would not exceed the limit prescribed in paragraph (a)(5) of the Progress Payments clause;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(8)</span> The parties agree on an appropriate rate; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(9)</span> The contractor agrees to certify annually, or more often if requested by the contracting officer, that the alternate rate continues to meet the conditions of sections 32.503-5 and 32.503-6. The certificate must be accompanied by adequate supporting information.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The contracting officer must change the liquidation rate in the following circumstances:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The rate must be increased for both previous and subsequent transactions, if the contractor experiences a lower profit rate than the rate anticipated at the time the liquidation rate was established. Accordingly, the contracting officer must adjust the progress payments associated with contract items already delivered, as well as subsequent progress payments.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The rate must be increased or decreased in keeping with the successive changes to the contract price or target profit when—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The target profit is changed under a fixed-price incentive contract with successive targets; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> A redetermined price involves a change in the profit element under a contract with prospective price redetermination at stated intervals.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Whenever the liquidation rate is changed, the contracting officer must issue a contract modification to specify the new rate in the Progress Payments clause. Adequate consideration for these contract modifications is provided by the consideration included in the initial contract. The parties must promptly make the payment or liquidation required in the circumstances.</p></div>
