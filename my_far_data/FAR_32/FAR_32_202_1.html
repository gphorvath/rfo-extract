<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Use of financing in contracts.</em> It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide all resources needed for performance of the contract. Thus, for purchases of commercial products or commercial services, financing of the contract is normally the contractor’s responsibility. However, in some markets the provision of financing by the buyer is a commercial practice. In these circumstances, the contracting officer may include appropriate financing terms in contracts for commercial purchases when doing so will be in the best interest of the Government.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e17"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Authorization.</em> Commercial interim payments and commercial advance payments may be made under the following circumstances-</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e25"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contract item financed is a commercial supply or service;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e30"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The contract price exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e35"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The contracting officer determines that it is appropriate or customary in the commercial marketplace to make financing payments for the item;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e40"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Authorizing this form of contract financing is in the best interest of the Government (see paragraph (e) of this section);</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e45"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Adequate security is obtained (see 32.202-4);</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e53"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> Prior to any performance of work under the contract, the aggregate of commercial advance payments must not exceed 15 percent of the contract price;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e58"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> The contract is awarded on the basis of competitive procedures or, if only one offer is solicited, adequate consideration is obtained (based on the time value of the additional financing to be provided) if the financing is expected to be substantially more advantageous to the offeror than the offeror’s normal method of customer financing; and</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e63"><span class="ph autonumber">(8)</span> The contracting officer obtains concurrence from the payment office concerning liquidation provisions when required by 32.206(e).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e71"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Difference from other than commercial financing.</em> Government financing of commercial purchases under this subpart is expected to be different from that used for other than commercial purchases under subpart  32.1 and its related subparts. While the contracting officer may adapt techniques and procedures from the other than commercial subparts for use in implementing commercial contract financing arrangements, the contracting officer must have a full understanding of effects of the differing contract environments and of what is needed to protect the interests of the Government in commercial contract financing.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e81"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Unusual contract financing.</em> Any contract financing arrangement not in accord with the requirements of agency regulations or this part is unusual contract financing and requires advance approval in accordance with agency procedures. If not otherwise specified, such unusual contract financing must be approved by the head of the contracting activity.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_32_202_1__d2062e88"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Best interest of the Government.</em> The statutes cited in 32.201 do not allow contract financing by the Government unless it is in the best interest of the United States. Agencies may establish standards to determine whether contract financing is in the best interest of the Government. These standards may be for certain types of procurements, certain types of items, or certain dollar levels of procurements.</p></div>
