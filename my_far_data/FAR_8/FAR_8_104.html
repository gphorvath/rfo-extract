<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> When supplies or services are unavailable from the mandatory sources listed above, agencies should procure commercial products and commercial services, including those that can be modified to fill agencies' needs, to the maximum extent possible, in accordance with the policy of Executive Order 14271, Ensuring Commercial, Cost-Effective Solutions in Federal Contracts. When a commercial product or commercial service meets an agency’s needs and is available on an existing contract or Blanket Purchase Agreement awarded for Governmentwide use (such as the Federal Supply Schedule, Governmentwide Acquisition Contract, or other Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity contracts), the agency -</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> must use the existing government-wide contract or blanket purchase agreement to buy the supply or service if the contract has been designated by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy a “required use” contract, unless the head of the contracting activity provides an exception (e.g., because the contract’s terms and conditions, scope, or performance period do not meet the agency’s needs); and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> should consider use of other existing government-wide contracts or blanket purchase agreements if there is not a suitable “required use” contract to meet the agency’s needs.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Agencies should also consider the use of shared services to fulfill requirements. A shared service is a business or mission function provided by one agency for consumption by multiple other agencies, either within or between federal agencies.</p></div>
