<div class="body conbody"><p class="p" id="FAR_43_206__d2594e8">The contracting officer may insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 52.243-7, Notification of Changes, in solicitations and contracts. The clause is available for use primarily in negotiated research and development or supply contracts for the acquisition of major weapon systems or principal subsystems. If the contract amount is expected to be less than $1,000,000, the clause shall not be used, unless the contracting officer anticipates that situations will arise where a contractor alleges that the Government has effected changes other than those identified in writing and signed by the contracting officer.</p></div>
