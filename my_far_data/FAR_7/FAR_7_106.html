Proposals submitted in response to such requirements may include the following:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Proposals to provide the Government the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive future acquisitions, together with the cost to the Government, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to use such data.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for competitive future acquisitions.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> In determining whether to apply paragraphs (a) and(b) of this section, planners must consider why the system is being acquired and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the contracting officer must consider them in evaluating competing offers. In noncompetitive awards, the contracting officer may consider the factors in paragraphs (a) and(b) of this section as objectives in negotiating the contract.</p></div>
