<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">Apply the following procedures unless an interagency agreement provides otherwise:</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_304_2__d1762e12"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> When a Government agency requests another Government agency award a contract on its behalf, the request should explain any special circumstances surrounding the contract and specify the patent rights clause. The clause should be selected and modified, if necessary, in accordance with the policies and procedures of this subpart. If, however, the request states that a clause of the requesting agency is required (e.g., because of statutory requirements, a deviation, or exceptional circumstances), then use that clause rather than those of this subpart.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_304_2__d1762e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> If the request states that an agency clause is required and the work to be performed under the contract is not severable and is funded wholly or in part by the requesting agency, then use the requesting agency clause and no other patent rights clause in the contract.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_304_2__d1762e26"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If the request states that an agency clause is required, and the work to be performed under the contract is severable, then apply the requesting agency clause only to the severable portion of the work. Apply the appropriate patent rights clause to the work for the awarding agency.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_304_2__d1762e31"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> If the request states that a requesting agency clause is not required in any resulting contract, then use the appropriate patent rights clause, if any.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_304_2__d1762e36"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Any action requiring an agency determination, report, or deviation involved in the use of the requesting agency's clause is the responsibility of the requesting agency unless the agencies agree otherwise. However, do not alter the requesting agency's clause without prior approval of the requesting agency.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_304_2__d1762e41"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The requesting agency may require, and provide instructions regarding, the forwarding or handling of any invention disclosures or other reporting requirements of the specified clauses. Normally, the requesting agency is responsible for the administration of any subject inventions. Establish this responsibility before awarding any contracts.</p></div>
