The determination must state that the Government will cancel or ignore the markings, and that the data will no longer be subject to disclosure prohibitions, unless the contractor files suit within 90 days in a court of competent jurisdiction. Absent such a suit, the contracting officer's determination ordinarily becomes the final agency decision. Therefore, do not cancel or ignore the markings until final resolution of the matter, either by the determination becoming the final agency decision or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if the contractor files suit.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_5__d1781e51"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Modify the foregoing procedures in accordance with agency regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) as necessary to respond to a request. In addition, the contractor may bring a claim, in accordance with the Disputes clause of the contract, that may arise as the result of the Government's action to remove or ignore any markings on data, unless the action occurs as the result of a final disposition of the matter by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_27_404_5__d1781e59"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Omitted or incorrect notices</em>.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_5__d1781e65"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> For data delivered under a contract containing the clause without a limited rights notice or restricted rights notice, and without a copyright notice, presume the contractor delivered the data with unlimited rights, and the Government assumes no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of the data.
