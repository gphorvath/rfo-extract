<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> In contracts for basic or applied research with universities or colleges, agencies must not restrict the conduct of or reporting on the results of unclassified basic or applied research, except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. However, agencies may restrict the release or disclosure of computer software that is or is intended to be developed to the point of practical application (including for agency distribution under established programs). This is not a restriction on the reporting of the results of basic or applied research. Agencies may also preclude a contractor from asserting copyright in any computer software for purposes of established agency distribution programs, or where required to accomplish the purpose for acquiring the software.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Except for the results of basic or applied research under contracts with universities or colleges, agencies may, to the extent provided in their FAR supplements, place limitations or restrictions on the contractor's exercise of its rights in data first produced in the performance of the contract, including a requirement to assign copyright to the Government or another party. Include any of these restrictions in the contract.</p></div>
