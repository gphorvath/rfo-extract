<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_406_3__d1791e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The clause at 52.227-21, Technical Data Declaration, Revision, and Withholding of Payment—Major Systems, implements 41 U.S.C. 2302(e). When using the clause at 52.227-21, the section of the contract specifying data delivery requirements (see 27.406-1(b)) must expressly identify those line items of technical data to which the clause applies. Upon delivery of the technical data, review the technical data and the contractor's declaration relating to it to assure that the data are complete, accurate, and comply with contract requirements. If the data are not complete, accurate, or compliant, request the contractor to correct the deficiencies and withhold payment as necessary. Do not make final payment under the contract until determining that the delivery requirements of those line items of data to which the clause applies have been satisfactorily met.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_406_3__d1791e27"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> In a contract for, or in support of, a major system awarded by a civilian agency other than NASA or the U.S. Coast Guard, the following applies:</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_406_3__d1791e33"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Require the delivery of any technical data relating to the major system or supplies for the major system, that are to be developed exclusively with Federal funds where delivery of the technical data is needed to ensure competitive acquisition of supplies or services required in substantial quantities in the future. Use the clause at 52.227-22, Major System—Minimum Rights, in addition to the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, and other required clauses, to ensure that the Government acquires at least those rights required by Pub. L. 98-577 in technical data developed exclusively with Federal funds.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_406_3__d1791e44"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Do not require a person that has developed a product or process, offered or to be offered for sale to the public, to provide technical data relating to a major system, or to supplies for a major system, that also relates to the design, development or manufacture of the product or process, as a condition of procurement of the product or process. This prohibition does not apply to such data that might be necessary for the Government to operate or maintain the product, or to use the process, where the Government obtains the data during contract performance.</p></div>
