<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General</em>. The basic clause at , Rights in Data-General, enables the contractor to protect qualifying limited rights data and restricted computer software by withholding the data from the Government and instead delivering form, fit, and function data.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e20"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Alternate definition of limited rights data</em>. For contracts not requiring the development, use, or delivery of items, components, or processes intended to be acquired by or for the Government, an agency may adopt the alternate definition of limited rights data set forth in Alternate I to the clause at 52.227-14. The alternate definition does not require that the data pertain to items, components, or processes developed at private expense. The alternate definition instead requires that the data were developed at private expense and embody a trade secret or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged.</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e30"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Protection of limited rights data specified for delivery.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e36"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The clause at 52.227-14 with its Alternate II enables the Government to require delivery of limited rights data rather than allow the contractor to withhold the data. To obtain delivery, the contract may identify and specify data to be delivered, or the contracting officer may require, by written request during contract performance, the delivery of data that has been withheld or identified to be withheld under paragraph (g)(1) of the clause. In addition, the contract may specifically identify data that are not to be delivered under Alternate II or that, if delivered, will be delivered with limited rights. The limited rights obtained by the Government are set forth in the Limited Rights Notice contained in paragraph (g)(3) of Alternate II. Agencies must not, without permission of the contractor, use limited rights data for purposes of manufacture or disclose the data outside the Government except as set forth in the Notice. Any disclosure by the Government must be subject to prohibition against further use and disclosure by the recipient. Here follow examples of specific purposes an agency may adopt in its supplement and added to the Limited Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(3) of Alternate II of the clause:</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e45"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Use (except for manufacture) by support service contractors.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e50"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Evaluation by nongovernment evaluators.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e55"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Use (except for manufacture) by other contractors participating in the Government’s program of which the specific contract is a part.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e60"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Emergency repair or overhaul work.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e65"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Release to a foreign government, or its instrumentalities, if required to serve the interests of the U.S. Government, for information or evaluation, or for emergency repair or overhaul work by the foreign government.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e70"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The provision at 52.227-15, Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software, helps determine use of the clause at 52.227-14 with its Alternate II by requesting the offeror state whether limited rights data are likely to be delivered. Where limited rights data are expected to be delivered, use Alternate II. Where negotiations are based on an unsolicited proposal, address the need for Alternate II of the clause at 52.227-14 during negotiations or discussions, and include Alternate II by modification, if needed, during contract performance.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e84"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> If data that would otherwise qualify as limited rights data is delivered as a computer database, treat the data as limited rights data, rather than restricted computer software, for the purposes of paragraph (g) of the clause at 52.227-14.</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e92"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Protection of restricted computer software specified for delivery.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e98"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Alternate III of the clause at 52.227-14, enables the Government to require delivery of restricted computer software rather than allow the contractor to withhold such software. To obtain delivery of restricted computer software—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e107"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Identify and specify the deliverable computer software in the contract; or</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e112"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Require by written request during contract performance, the delivery of computer software that has been withheld or identified to be withheld under paragraph (g)(1) of the clause.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e117"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> In considering whether to use Alternate III, note that, unlike other data, computer software is itself also an end item. Therefore, use Alternate III where the contract requires delivery of restricted computer software.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e122"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Unless otherwise agreed (see paragraph (d)(4) of this subsection), the restricted rights the Government obtains are set forth in the Restricted Rights Notice contained in paragraph (g)(4) (Alternate III). The Government will not use or reproduce such restricted computer software, or disclose it outside the Government, except that the Government may—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e128"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Use or copy the software for the computers for which it was acquired, including use at any Government installation to which the computers may be transferred;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e133"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Use or copy the software for a backup computer if any computer for which it was acquired is inoperative;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e138"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Reproduce the software for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e143"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Modify, adapt or combine the software with other computer software, provided that the modified, adapted, or combined portions of the derivative software incorporating any of the delivered, restricted computer software must be subject to the same restricted rights;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e151"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Disclose to and reproduce the software for use by support service contractors or their subcontractors, in accordance with paragraphs (3)(i) through (iv) of this section; and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e156"><span class="ph autonumber">(vi)</span> Use or copy the software for a replacement computer.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e161"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The restricted rights set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection comprise the minimum rights the Government normally obtains with restricted computer software and will automatically apply when the Government acquires such software under the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III of the clause at 52.227-14. However, the contracting officer may specify different rights in the contract, consistent with the purposes and needs for which the software is to be acquired. For example, the contracting officer should consider any networking needs or any requirements for use of the computer software from remote terminals. Also, in addressing such needs, the scope of the restricted rights may differ for the documentation accompanying the computer software than for the programs and databases. The contract, or a collateral agreement incorporated in and made part of the contract, must expressly state any additions to, or limitations on, the restricted rights set forth in the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III of the clause at 52.227-14; modify the notice accordingly.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_2__d1778e172"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> The provision at 52.227-15, Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software, helps determine use of the clause at 52.227-14 with its Alternate III by requesting the offeror state whether restricted computer software is likely to be delivered under the contract. In addition, address the need for Alternate III during negotiations or discussions with an offeror, particularly negotiations upon an unsolicited proposal. However, add Alternate III by modification, if needed, during contract performance.</p></div>
