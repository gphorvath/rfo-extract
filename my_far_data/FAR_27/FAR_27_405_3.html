<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_405_3__d1786e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> When acquiring commercial computer software, no specific contract clause prescribed in this subpart is necessary, but the contract must specifically address the Government's rights to use, disclose, modify, distribute, and reproduce the software. Part 12 states guidance for acquisition of commercial computer software, and it states that commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation must be acquired under licenses customarily provided to the public to the extent the license is consistent with Federal law and otherwise satisfies the Government's needs. In addition, the contract must adequately describe the computer programs and/or databases, the media on which it is recorded, and all the necessary documentation.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_405_3__d1786e34"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> If the contract incorporates, refers to, or uses a vendor's standard commercial lease, license, or purchase agreement, ensure that the agreement is consistent with paragraph (a) of this subsection. Exercise caution in accepting a vendor's terms and conditions, because they might pertain to commercial sales and might therefore be inappropriate for Government contracts. Address in the contract any inconsistencies in a vendor's standard commercial agreement, and the contract terms must take precedence over the vendor's standard commercial agreement.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_405_3__d1786e42"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> If a prime contractor under a contract containing the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in Dataâ€”General, with paragraph (g)(4) (Alternate III) in the clause, acquires restricted computer software from a subcontractor (at any tier) as a separate acquisition for delivery to or for use on behalf of the Government, the contracting officer may approve any additions to, or limitations on the restricted rights in the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) in a collateral agreement incorporated in and made part of the contract.</p></div>
