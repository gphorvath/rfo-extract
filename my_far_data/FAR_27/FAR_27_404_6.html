<div class="body conbody"><p class="p" id="FAR_27_404_6__d1789e8">Contracting officers may obtain the right to inspect data at the contractor's facility by use of the clause at 52.227-14 with its Alternate V, which adds paragraph (j) to provide that right. Agencies may also adopt Alternate V for general use. The data subject to inspection may be data withheld or withholdable under paragraph (g)(1) of the clause. The contracting officer or designee (including nongovernmental personnel under the same conditions as the contracting officer) may inspect data at the contractor's facility to verify a contractor's assertion regarding the limited rights or restricted rights status of the data, or for evaluating work performance under the contract. The Government may exercise this right up to 3 years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under the contract. The contract may specify data items not subject to inspection under paragraph (j) of the Alternate. If the contractor demonstrates to the contracting officer that a conflict of interest would possibly result if inspection were made by a particular representative, then designate an alternate representative.</p></div>
