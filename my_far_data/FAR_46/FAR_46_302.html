<div class="body conbody"><p class="p" id="FAR_46_302__d2690e8">The contracting officer must insert the clause at 52.246-2, Inspection of Supplies-Fixed-Price, in solicitations and contracts for supplies, or services that involve the furnishing of supplies, when a fixed-price contract is contemplated and the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The contracting officer may insert the clause in such solicitations and contracts when the contract amount is expected to be at or below the simplified acquisition threshold and inclusion of the clause is in the Governmentâ€™s interest. If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, the contracting officer must use the clause with its Alternate I. If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, the contracting officer must use the clause with its Alternate II.</p></div>
