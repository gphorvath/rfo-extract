<div class="body conbody"><p class="p" id="FAR_46_202_1__d2683e8">When acquiring commercial products (see partÂ 12), the Government must rely on contractors' existing quality assurance systems as a substitute for Government inspection and testing before tender for acceptance unless customary market practices for the commercial product being acquired include in-process inspection. Any in-process inspection by the Government must be conducted in a manner consistent with commercial practice. The Government must rely on the contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that commercial services acquired conform to contract requirements before they are tendered to the Government.</p></div>
