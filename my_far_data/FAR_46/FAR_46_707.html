                <h2>46.707 Pricing aspects of fixed-price incentive contract warranties.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p" id="FAR_46_707__d2730e8">If a fixed-price incentive contract contains a warranty, the estimated cost of the warranty to the contractor should be considered in establishing the incentive target price and the ceiling price of the contract. All costs incurred, or estimated to be incurred, by the contractor in complying with the warranty must be considered when establishing the total final price. Contractor compliance with the warranty after the establishment of the total final price must be at no additional cost to the Government.</p></div>
