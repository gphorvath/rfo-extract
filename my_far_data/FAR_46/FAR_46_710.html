                <h2>46.710 Contract clauses.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p" id="FAR_46_710__d2729e8">The clauses and alternates prescribed in this section may be used in solicitations and contracts in which inclusion of a warranty is appropriate (see 46.709 for warranties for commercial products and commercial services). However, because of the many situations that may influence the warranty terms and conditions appropriate to a particular acquisition, the contracting officer may vary the terms and conditions of the clauses and alternates to the extent necessary. The alternates prescribed in this section address the clauses; however, the conditions pertaining to each alternate must be considered if the terms and conditions are varied to meet a particular need.</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_46_710__d2729e15"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_46_710__d2729e20"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer may insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 52.246-17, Warranty of Supplies of a Noncomplex Nature, in solicitations and contracts for noncomplex items when a fixed-price supply contract is contemplated and the use of a warranty clause has been approved under agency procedures.
