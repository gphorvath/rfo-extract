The contracting officer may withdraw approval at any time based on a determination that the contractor’s purchasing system has deteriorated or to protect the Government’s interest. </p><p>(b) When approval is withheld or withdrawn, the contracting officer must notify the contractor in writing within 10 days after completing the review. The notice must specify the deficiencies that must be corrected to qualify the system for approval and request the contractor to furnish within 15 days a plan to correct the deficiencies. If the plan is accepted, the contracting officer must make a follow-up review as soon as the contractor notifies the contracting officer that the deficiencies have been corrected. </p><p>(c) The contracting officer must withhold or withdraw approval when the contractor consistently does not comply with requirements.</p></div>
