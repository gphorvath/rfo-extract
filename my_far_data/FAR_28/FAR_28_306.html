<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_28_306__d1850e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General</em>. Although the Government is not ordinarily concerned with the contractor’s insurance coverage if the contract is a fixed-price contract, in special circumstances agencies may specify insurance requirements under fixed-price contracts. Examples of such circumstances include the following:</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_28_306__d1850e18"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contractor is, or has a separate operation, engaged principally in Government work.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_28_306__d1850e23"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Government property is involved.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_28_306__d1850e28"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The work is to be performed on a Government installation.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_28_306__d1850e33"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The Government elects to assume risks for which the contractor ordinarily obtains commercial insurance.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_28_306__d1850e38"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Work on a Government installation.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_28_306__d1850e44"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> When the clause at 52.228-5, Insurance—Work on a Government Installation, is required to be included in a fixed-price contract by 28.310, the coverage specified in 28.307 is the minimum insurance required and must be included in the contract Schedule or elsewhere in the contract. The contracting officer may require additional coverage and higher limits.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_28_306__d1850e58"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> When the clause at 52.228-5, Insurance—Work on a Government Installation, is not required by 28.310 but is included because the contracting officer considers it to be in the Government's interest to do so, any of the types of insurance specified in 28.307 may be omitted or the limits may be lowered, if appropriate.</p></div>
