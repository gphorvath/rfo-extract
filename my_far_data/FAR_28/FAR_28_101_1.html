Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, bid guarantees must be required whenever a performance bond or a performance and payment bond is required.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_28_101_1__d1803e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> All types of bid guarantees are acceptable for supply or service contracts (see annual bid bonds and annual performance bonds coverage in 28.001). Only separate bid guarantees are acceptable in connection with construction contracts. Agencies may specify that only separate bid bonds are acceptable in connection with construction contracts.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_28_101_1__d1803e29"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The chief of the contracting office may waive the requirement to obtain a bid guarantee when a performance bond or a performance and payment bond is required if it is determined that a bid guarantee is not in the best interest of the Government for a specific acquisition (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> overseas construction, emergency acquisitions, sole-source contracts). Class waivers may be authorized by the agency head or designee.</p></div>
