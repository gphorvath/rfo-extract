When any of those types of security are deposited, a statement must be incorporated in the bond form pledging the security in lieu of execution of the bond form by corporate or individual sureties. The contractor must execute the bond forms as the principal. Agencies must establish safeguards to protect against loss of the security and must return the security or its equivalent to the contractor when the bond obligation has ceased.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_28_204__d1839e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Upon written request by any contractor securing a performance or payment bond by any of the types of security listed in 28.204-1 through 28.204-3, the contracting officer may release a portion of the security only when the conditions allowing the partial release of security in 28.203-3(c) are met.

During the period for which a bond supported by security is required, the contractor may substitute one type of security listed in 28.204-1 through 28.204-3 for another, or may substitute, in whole or combination, additional surety bonds under 28.202 or  <a aria-label="28.203.
